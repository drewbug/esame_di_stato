The Super Bowl at 50, and beyond

PART 1: Reading Comprehension

The National Football League (NFL) and the game of American football enjoy the widest fan
following by far in the United States, including the top-rated show on television (“Sunday Night
Football”) and the most-watched show in American television history (last season’s Super Bowl).
But our world is changing rapidly. We carefully study how young people all over the globe connect
to sports differently now because of technology, which is also allowing us to improve our game and
the fan experience.

As we celebrate the 50th season of our Super Bowl and look to the next 50 years, we recognise the
importance of becoming a core part of today’s global sports landscape that ignores boundaries of
geography and time. Sports fans can now access sports entertainment from anywhere in the world, at
any time and on any device.

Technology is driving the change. Although broadcast television remains the bedrock of how
Americans experience the NFL, consumers are watching more video on multiple devices than ever
before. In 2013, for the first time, Americans spent more time on the internet or with their mobile
phone than watching TV, and the gap continues to widen. As a result, people are interacting with
sport and each other in new ways. Social-media platforms enable people to share, discuss and support
the things they feel most passionate about. Nowhere is this more pronounced than among
“millennials”, who comprise the largest generation in history. Millennials are still watching television
but they are now doing half of their viewing on screens other than TVs. They are digital-media
natives, not passive viewers. They expect to find and share the content they love in a seamless way
on the devices and places of their choosing. We are adapting to this.

Technology is also helping us make advances in player medical care and officiating, and in creating
the high-tech sideline of the future for teams and a better stadium experience for fans. This will
include the next generation of player and team statistics based on video and wearable technology. It
will take fans deeper inside the game, breaking it down into interesting pieces of data such as how
fast players are moving or changing direction.
As it has done on television for decades, American football has a uniquely powerful ability to convene
mass audiences on these new mobile and social platforms. We have formed partnerships with
Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube and others. NFL Mobile, NFL Game Pass and other direct-to-consumer
NFL platforms are experiencing enormous growth. Fantasy Football, a game enjoyed almost
exclusively on internet-connected devices, has never been more popular. There has been significant
growth in female fantasy players over the past five years. In these and other ways, fans are engaging
with NFL football 24 hours a day, year-round.

The NFL was built by reaching as many fans as possible with our live games. Technology now gives
us the ability to accomplish this globally. In October 2015 we streamed a game online for the first
time – Buffalo playing against Jacksonville in London – via Yahoo to a worldwide audience free.
Through deployment of media rights, we have built a platform for fans to access our games globally.
And they want more. We are now playing three regular-season games a year in London, but we are
expanding our horizons. There are more opportunities in Canada and Mexico, where we already have
a strong foothold as the second-most popular sport in each market. We also have opportunities to
accelerate our growth in China, Germany and Brazil.

This reach will transform the scope and passion of non-American fans and create demand for more.
What could this demand look like? Potentially it could mean a team or teams based outside the United
States, regular-season games in Mexico, Latin America and Europe, and teams holding training
camps, pre-season games and skills camps beyond America.

A global stage brings with it crucial responsibility. We must earn the respect of the public every day
by living up to our core values on and off the playing field. This means making our game better, more
exciting, more accessible and safer. It means having the courage to do what’s right and address issues
in a thoughtful, realistic way guided by what’s best for the long term.
On a technology-driven, hyper-connected, mobile world stage, it cannot be any other way. …
