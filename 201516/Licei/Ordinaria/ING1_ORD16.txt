Europe needs many more babies to avert a population disaster

When Spanish business consultant Alejandro Macarrón started crunching the numbers behind Spain’s
changing demographics, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. “I was astonished,” said Macarrón. “We
have provinces in Spain where for every baby born, more than two people die. And the ratio is moving
closer to one to three.”

Spain has one of the lowest fertility rates in the EU, with an average of 1.27 children born for every
woman of childbearing age, compared to the EU average of 1.55. Its crippling economic crisis has seen a
net exodus of people from the country, as hundreds of thousands of Spaniards and migrants leave in the
hope of finding jobs abroad. The result is that, since 2012, Spain’s population has been shrinking.
Record numbers of economic migrants and asylum-seekers are seeking to enter the European Union this
summer and are risking their lives in the attempt. The paradox is that as police and security forces battle
to keep them at bay, a demographic crisis is unfolding across the continent. Europe desperately needs
more young people to run its health services, populate its rural areas and look after its elderly because,
increasingly, its societies are no longer self-sustaining.
In Portugal, the population has been shrinking since 2010. For many analysts, the question now is how
low can it go, with projections by the National Statistics Institute suggesting Portugal’s population could
drop from 10.5 million to 6.3 million by 2060. According to Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho:
“We’ve got really serious problems.”
In Italy the retired population is soaring, with the proportion of over-65s set to rise from 2.7% last year to
18.8% in 2050. Germany has the lowest birthrate in the world: 8.2 per 1,000 population between 2008
and 2013, according to a recent study by the Hamburg-based world economy institute, the HWWI.
The UK’s population reached 64.6 million by mid-2014, a growth of 491,000 over the previous year,
according to the Office for National Statistics. On average, Britain’s population grew at a faster rate over
the last decade than it has done over the last 50 years.

Macarrón is astonished at the reluctance of Spanish authorities to address what he calls a direct threat to
economic growth as well as pensions, healthcare and social services. He and a few friends took it upon
themselves to begin tackling the issue, starting the non-profit group Demographic Renaissance in 2013,
with the aim of raising awareness of the crisis.
“Most people think we’re only talking about something that will be a problem in 50 years, but we’re
already seeing part of the problem,” he said. “If current numbers hold, every new generation of
Spaniards will be 40% smaller than the previous one.”

A political knock-on effect is the overwhelming political power of the grey vote. Macarrón points to the
crippling austerity measure put in place during the economic crisis: “During the same time frame,
expenditures on pensions rose by more than 40%. We’re moving closer to being a gerontocratic society –
it’s a government of the old.”

The region of Galicia is one of the few in Spain that has addressed the issue. The population of this northwestern region has been shrinking, leaving it home to nearly half [of] Spain’s abandoned villages. More
than 1,500 settlements – once home to schools, businesses and filled with children – now sit abandoned,
overgrown with weeds and bushes.
In 2012, the regional government launched a multi-pronged initiative to address the falling fertility rate,
with plans to roll out measures such as home and transport subsidies for families and radio
advertisements urging women to have more children. But it is still estimated that Galicia’s population
could shrink by 1 million residents in the next 40 years, a loss of just under one third of the region’s
population.
For southern Europe, migration within the EU has become a grave problem. Hundreds of thousands of
Portuguese have left, hoping to find better opportunities abroad. Coelho has said the next 10 to 15 years
would be decisive in reversing the trend. If no action is taken, he said last year, “these issues will only be
solved by a miracle.” […]

The problem of systematically rejecting the past arises only when innovation is recognized both as
inescapable and as socially desirable: when it represents “progress”. This raises two distinct questions,
how innovation as such is recognized and legitimized, and how the situation arising from it is to be
specified (that is how a model of society is to be formulated when the past can no longer provide it). The
former is more easily answered.
We know very little about the process which has turned the words “new” and “revolutionary” (as used
in the language of advertising) into synonyms for “better” and “more desirable”, and research is badly
needed here. However, it would seem that novelty or even constant innovation is more readily accepted
as far as it concerns the human control over non-human nature, for example science and technology,
since so much of it is obviously advantageous even to the most tradition-bound. Has there ever been a
serious example of Luddism directed against bicycles or transistor radios? On the other hand, while
certain socio-political innovations may appear attractive to some groups of human beings, at least
prospectively, the social and human implications of innovation (including technical innovation) tend to
meet with greater resistance, for equally obvious reasons. Rapid and constant change in material
technology may be hailed by the very people who are profoundly upset by the experience of rapid
change in human (for example sexual and family) relations, and who might actually find it hard to
conceive of constant change in such relations. Where even palpably “useful” material innovation is
rejected, it is generally, perhaps always, because of the fear of the social innovation, that is disruption, it
entails.
Innovation which is so obviously useful and socially neutral that it is accepted almost automatically, at
all events by people to whom technological change is familiar, raises virtually no problem of
legitimation. One would guess (but has the subject actually been investigated?) that even so
traditionalist an activity as popular institutional religion has found little difficulty in accepting it. We
know of violent resistance to any change in the ancient holy texts, but there appears to have been no
equivalent resistance to, say, the cheapening of holy images and icons by means of modern
technological processes, such as prints and oleographs. On the other hand certain innovations require
legitimation, and in periods when the past ceases to provide any precedent for them, this raises very
grave difficulties. A single dose of innovation, however great, is not so troublesome. It can be presented
as the victory of some permanent positive principle over its opposite, or as a process of “correction” or
“rectification”, reason prevailing over unreason, knowledge over ignorance, “nature” over the
“unnatural”, good over evil. But the basic experience of the past two centuries has been constant and
continued change, which cannot be so dealt with except sometimes, at the cost of considerable casuistry,
as the constantly necessary application of permanent principles to circumstances ever changing in ways
which remain rather mysterious, or by exaggerating the strength of the surviving forces of evil.
Paradoxically, the past remains the most useful analytical tool for coping with constant change, but in a
novel form. It turns into the discovery of history as a process of directional change, of development or
evolution. Change thus becomes its own legitimation, but it is thereby anchored to a transformed “sense

of the past”. Bagehot’s Physics and Politics (1872) is a good nineteenth-century example of this; current
concepts of “modernization” illustrate more simple-minded versions of the same approach. In brief,
what legitimates the present and explains it is not now the past as a set of reference points (for example
Magna Carta), or even as duration (for example the age of parliamentary institutions) but the past as a
process of becoming the present. Faced with the overriding reality of change, even conservative thought
becomes historicist. Perhaps, because hindsight is the most persuasive form of the historian’s wisdom, it
suits them better than most.
But what of these who also require foresight to specify a future which is unlike anything in the past? […]

50

Some sort of historicism, that is the more or less sophisticated and complex extrapolation of past
tendencies into the future, has been the most convenient and popular method of prediction. At all events
the shape of the future is discerned by searching the process of past development for clues, so that
paradoxically, the more we expect innovation, the more history becomes essential to discover what it
will be like.

When it came to concealing his troubles, Tommy Wilhelm was not less capable than the next fellow.
So at least he thought, and there was a certain amount of evidence to back him up. He had once been an
actor – no, not quite, an extra – and he knew what acting should be. Also, he was smoking a cigar, and
when a man is smoking a cigar, wearing a hat, he has an advantage; it is harder to find out how he
feels. He came from the twenty-third floor down to the lobby on the mezzanine to collect his mail
before breakfast, and he believed – he hoped – that he looked passably well: doing all right. It was a
matter of sheer hope, because there was not much that he could add to his present effort. On the
fourteenth floor he looked for his father to enter the elevator; they often met at this hour, on the way to
breakfast. If he worried about his appearance it was mainly for his old father’s sake. But there was no
stop on the fourteenth, and the elevator sank and sank. Then the smooth door opened and the great
dark-red uneven carpet that covered the lobby billowed toward Wilhelm’s feet. In the foreground the
lobby was dark, sleepy. French drapes like sails kept out the sun, but three high, narrow windows were
open, and in the blue air Wilhelm saw a pigeon about to light on the great chain that supported the
marquee of the movie house directly underneath the lobby. For one moment he heard the wings beating
strongly.
Most of the guests at the Hotel Gloriana were past the age of retirement. Along Broadway in the
Seventies, Eighties, and Nineties, a great part of New York’s vast population of old men and women
lives. Unless the weather is too cold or wet they fill the benches about the tiny railed parks and along
the subway gratings from Verdi Square to Columbia University, they crowd the shops and cafeterias,
the dime stores, the tearooms, the bakeries, the beauty parlors, the reading rooms and club rooms.
Among these old people at the Gloriana, Wilhelm felt out of place. He was comparatively young, in his
middle forties, large and blond, with big shoulders; his back was heavy and strong, if already a little
stooped or thickened. After breakfast the old guests sat down on the green leather armchairs and sofas
in the lobby and began to gossip and look into the papers; they had nothing to do but wait out the day.
But Wilhelm was used to an active life and liked to go out energetically in the morning. And for
several months, because he had no position, he had kept up his morale by rising early; he was shaved
and in the lobby by eight o’clock. He bought the paper and some cigars and drank a Coca-Cola or two
before he went in to breakfast with his father. After breakfast – out, out, out to attend to business. The
getting out had in itself become the chief business. But he had realized that he could not keep this up
much longer, and today he was afraid. He was aware that his routine was about to break up and he
sensed that a huge trouble long presaged but till now formless was due. Before evening, he’d know.
Nevertheless he followed his daily course and crossed the lobby.
Rubin, the man at the newsstand, had poor eyes. They may not have been actually weak but they were
poor in expression, with lacy lids that furled down at the corners. He dressed well. It didn’t seem
necessary – he was behind the counter most of the time – but he dressed very well. He had on a rich
brown suit; the cuffs embarrassed the hairs on his small hands. He wore a Countess Mara painted
necktie. As Wilhelm approached, Rubin did not see him; he was looking out dreamily at the Hotel

Ansonia, which was visible from his corner, several blocks away. The Ansonia, the neighborhood’s
great landmark, was built by Stanford White. It looks like a baroque palace from Prague or Munich
enlarged a hundred times, with towers, domes, huge swells and bubbles of metal gone green from
exposure, iron fretwork and festoons. Black television antennae are densely planted on its round
summits. Under the changes of weather it may look like marble or like sea water, black as slate in the
fog, white as tufa in sunlight. This morning it looked like the image of itself reflected in deep water,
white and cumulous above, with cavernous distortions underneath. Together, the two men gazed at it.

Aesthetic behaviour is the pursuit of beauty. This is easy to say but difficult to explain, because beauty
is such an elusive quality, especially when viewed biologically. It bears no obvious relationship to any
of the basic survival patterns of the human animal, such as feeding, mating, sleeping or parental care.
And yet it cannot be ignored, because any objective survey of the way people spend their time must
include many hours of beauty-reaction. There is no other way to describe the response of men and
women who can be found standing silently in front of paintings in an art gallery, or sitting quietly
listening to music, or watching dancing, or viewing sculpture, or gazing at flowers, or wandering
through landscapes, or savouring wines. In each of these cases the human sense-organs are passing
impressions to the brain, the receipt of which appears to be the only goal involved. The advanced
wine-taster even goes so far as to spit out the wine after tasting it, as if to underline that it is his need
for beauty that is being quenched and not his thirst.
It is true to say that virtually every human creature expresses itself aesthetically in some way or other,
so the need to experience the beauty-reaction has a global importance. It is also true to say that there
are no absolutes involved. Nothing is considered to be beautiful by all peoples everywhere. Every
revered object of beauty is considered ugly by someone, somewhere. This fact makes nonsense of a
great deal of aesthetic theory, and many find it hard to accept. There is so often the feeling that this, or
that, particular form of beauty really does have some intrinsic value, some universal validity that
simply must be appreciated by everyone. But the hard truth is that beauty is in the brain of the beholder
and nowhere else. […]
Turning to the question of invented aesthetics, we move into the area usually designated as Art. Art
can best be defined as man-made beauty, and it appears in two main forms: the Performing Arts and
the Plastic Arts. The Performing Arts provide an aesthetic event; the Plastic Arts provide an aesthetic
object. In both cases, the sense of beauty comes primarily from our subtle comparisons and
classifications of set themes, as it did with natural objects. The difference, of course, is that with
natural beauty the theme is merely isolated from the world around us. We do not invent it, we only
isolate it. In the case of the arts, however, we create it ourselves.
This gives rise to a new problem: how to arrive at a theme, so that its variations can then be enjoyed.
If, for example, we were going to enjoy the beauty of wild animals or wild flowers, there would be no
creativity involved. They existed already, and evolution had done the creative work for us. But if we
now decide to compose music or paint pictures we have to impose our own evolutionary forces on the
works we invent.
For the painter staring at a blank canvas or the composer sitting in front of a silent piano, there is total
responsibility. He starts from nothing, or, rather, from everything. His initial choice at the beginning of
a work of art is theoretically completely open. Any shape can be drawn. Any note can be played. This is
the special, additional challenge for the artist, as opposed to the individual reacting to natural beauty.
How does he meet it?

The answer is that he quickly imposes on himself a highly restricted form. In a word, he formalizes.
Any form will do, just so long as it contains the potential for a complex set of variations. He may copy
the form from nature – a tree, for instance – or he may steal a scale of notes from bird-song. Or he may
paint a geometric pattern from some geological structure as his starting point. Once he has begun to
experiment with forms he has wrested from nature, he can then rapidly shift his themes further and
further away from the natural starting point until the themes he employs are relatively abstract. With
music this process took place long, long ago. The visual arts are, by contrast, only recently beginning
to explore the more abstract possibilities of painting and sculpture.
Either way, whether staying close to imitated natural objects, or creating entirely novel abstracted
compositions, the artist’s work is judged, finally, not on any absolute values, but on the basis of how
ingeniously he manages to ring the changes on the themes he has employed. […]

piattaforme tradizionali di informazione che offrono i loro contenuti in rete (quotidiani,
periodici, radio, tv, agenzie di stampa), ai nuovi soggetti attivi nella produzione di notizie (le
testate native digitali), fino a tutte le nuove forme di offerta online (aggregatori e social media)
che (ri)aggregano notizie presenti in rete, rendono possibile la condivisione delle stesse, offrono
nuovi punti di vista e commenti sia di professionisti della comunicazione (giornalisti, politici,
esperti), sia di normali cittadini (dai blog alla condivisione sociale, passando per il citizen
journalism)”.
Rifletti su come ti poni personalmente nei confronti di questa molteplice offerta di informazione
e su quali accorgimenti ritieni necessari per un uso consapevole e critico da parte dei cittadini di
una varietà così ampia di fonti di notizie.

She stood at the foot of the heap, which rose before in a great shining white mountain against the
vivid sky, her back to the patient oxen which were standing motionless with their heads lowered,
waiting till the wagon should be emptied and they free to move off on another trip. She watched the
natives, thinking about the farm, and swinging the sambok from her wrist so that it made snaky
patterns in the red dust. Suddenly she noticed that one of the boys was not working. He had fallen out
of line, and was standing by, breathing heavily, his face shining with sweat. She glanced down at her
watch. One minute passed, then two. But still he stood, his arms folded, motionless. She waited till
the hand of the watch had passed the third minute, in growing indignation that he should have the
temerity to remain idle when he should know by now her rule that no one should exceed the allowed
one-minute pause. Then she said, “Get back to work.” He looked at her with the expression common
to African laborers: a blank look, as if he hardly saw her, as if there was an obsequious surface with
which he faced her and her kind, covering an invulnerable and secret hinterland. In a leisurely way he
unfolded his arms and turned away. He was going to fetch himself some water from the petrol tin that
stood under a bush for coolness, nearby. She said again, sharply, her voice rising: “I said, get back to
work.”
At this he stopped still, looked at her squarely, and said in his own dialect which she did not
understand, “I want to drink.”
“Don’t talk that gibberish to me,” she snapped. She looked around for the bossboy who was not in
sight.
The man said, in a halting ludicrous manner, “I… want… water.” He spoke in English, and suddenly
smiled and opened his mouth and pointed his finger down his throat. She could hear the other natives
laughing a little from where they stood on the mealie dump. Their laughter which was good-humored,
drove her suddenly mad with anger: she thought it was aimed at her, whereas these men were only
taking the opportunity to laugh at something, anything at all, in the middle of their work; one of
themselves speaking bad English and sticking his finger down his throat was as good a thing to laugh
at as any other.
But most white people think it is “cheek” if a native speaks English. She said, breathless with anger,
“Don’t speak English to me,” and then stopped. This man was shrugging and smiling and turning his
eyes up to heaven as if protesting that she had forbidden him to speak his own language, and then
hers - so what was he to speak? That lazy insolence stung her to an inarticulate rage. She opened her
mouth to storm at him, but remained speechless. And she saw in his eyes that sullen resentment, and
– what put the finishing touch to it – amused contempt.
Involuntarily she lifted her whip and brought it down across his face in a vicious swinging blow. She
did not know what she was doing. She stood quite still, trembling; and when she saw him put his
hand, dazedly to his face, she looked down at the whip she held in stupefaction; as if the whip
had swung out of its own accord, without her willing it. A thick weal pushed up along the dark skin
of the cheek as she looked, and from it a drop of bright blood gathered and trickled down and off

his chin, and splashed to his chest. He was a great hulk of a man, taller than any of the others,
magnificently built, with nothing on but an old sack tied round his waist. As she stood there,
frightened, he seemed to tower over her. On his big chest another red drop fell and trickled down
to his waist.
Then she saw him make a sudden movement, and recoiled, terrified; she thought he was going to
attack her. But he only wiped the blood off his face with a big hand that shook a little. She knew
that all the natives were standing behind her stock-still, watching the scene. In a voice that
sounded harsh from breathlessness, she said, “Now get back to work.”

Syrian refugees spark child labour boom in Istanbul
The children are underfoot, barefoot, buskers and beggars. They are Syrian refugees, and many are
fending for themselves on the streets of Istanbul.
Of the some two million Syrian refugees Turkey has taken in, an estimated 300,000 are living in
Istanbul. Children, it is believed, make up about 150,000 of that group.

At any given time, but especially late into the night, there are scores of children on Istiklal Street
off Taksim Square in Istanbul.
More than a million people walk the 2 kilometre stretch daily, but most ignore the children. As
stunning as it is to see even toddlers alone on the street, to many they've become wallpaper in a
busy city already bursting at the seams.

10

Hussein Yilmaz does what he can to get tourists' attention in Taksim Square. At 12 years old, he's
doing what so many other Syrian children are doing in Turkey.
"We sell tissues, what can we do?" he says. He can bring in the equivalent of about $10 a day
selling the small packets.

15

Yilmaz says he works because his father is injured and his mother, who worked at a restaurant for
a time, is now at home.
He says he used to like school, and even thought about being a teacher when he grows up.
However, the more time Yilmaz spends on the street being a breadwinner, the less likely it is he
will ever return to a classroom.

With "no education you become a child — 12 years old, 13 years old — who's responsible to find
income for your family," Gizem Demirci Al Kadah says.
She runs the Istanbul office of the aid agency ASAM, the Association for Solidarity with Asylum
Seekers and Migrants. It is a non-profit NGO, partially funded by the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees.

25

Demirci Al Kadah adds that in Syria the head of the family could work and support a family of
five, but "here in Turkey that's not possible." So, she says, the entire family needs to work.
Legislation to make it easier for Syrians to get work permits has not yet come into effect. Without
work permits, most families resort to begging and often use their children to do it.
Settlement and therapy: ASAM is helping families get settled in their new lives and trying to
make sure children stay children.

30

The waiting room in its Istanbul office is peppered with posters that say "you are safe here"
in several languages.
The agency provides social and psychological counseling, among other services. For the children
there is a special space a few blocks away, a light-filled school where they are protected at all
times.

[…] A bright classroom at the back of the building is covered in artwork made by the young
refugees. Some draw themselves and you'll see their feet are floating in the air — a sure sign,
Demirci Al Kadah says, that they feel every bit of the upheaval their families are experiencing.
She adds that as they become more comfortable and their situation slowly improves, their
drawings show their feet firmly on the ground.

40

School and stability: On the other side of Istanbul, in the conservative district of Fatih, another
more formal school is packed with classrooms, but this one bustles well into the night.
It is a Turkish private school during the day, and when those classes let out, another school goes
into session. Funded by wealthier Syrians, the school charges about $50 a month for those who
can afford to send their children.

45

Asmar Tyba is one of those lucky few. "We were living a good life in Syria before the war. It was a
really good life," he says.
The 17-year-old is now living in Istanbul with his mother. His father is in Syria. His older brother
is in Europe and sends money to support the family.
His entire world upended, Tyba is still making plans for university.

50

"Sometimes when I remember my family — we are separated [and] are living apart — I feel sad.
But then I say, 'No, I have to build my future, I have to focus on my studies.'" […]
