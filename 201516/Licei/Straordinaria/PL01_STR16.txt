What Happens When Millennials Run the Workplace?

Joel Pavelski, 27, isn’t the first person who has lied to his boss to scam some time off work.
But inventing a friend’s funeral, when in fact he was building a treehouse — then blogging and
tweeting about it to be sure everyone at the office noticed? That feels new.
Such was a recent management challenge at Mic, a five-year-old website in New York that is
vying to become a leading news source created by and for millennials. […]
“There’s 80 million millennials; we focus on the 40 that went to college,” said Chris Altchek,
Mic’s 28-year-old chief executive.
But he is still working out how to manage many of the traits associated with his fellow
millennials: a sense of entitlement, a tendency to overshare on social media, and frankness
verging on insubordination.
Mic’s staff of 106 looks a lot like its target demographic: trim 20-somethings, with beards on the
men and cute outfits on the women, who end every sentence with an exclamation point and use
the word “literally” a lot.
Their crowded newsroom on Hudson Street has an aggressively playful vibe, like a middleschool fraternity house. Some ride hoverboards into the kitchen for the free snacks. Others wield
Nerf dart guns or use a megaphone for ad hoc announcements. Dino, a white Maltese terrier
owned by the lead designer, snuffles between desks.
Mr. Altchek is proud of the freewheeling office culture. “It helps us to have everyone speak out
and best ideas rise to the top,” he said. “What that can feel like or sound like is rudeness. But I’d
rather have a lot of people speaking their minds than a very controlled environment.”
But running an office made up exclusively of millennials, it turns out, is not without its snags.
His philosophy was tested when Mr. Pavelski, Mic’s director of programming, requested a week
off, ostensibly to attend a wake back home in Wisconsin. “I went to talk to Joel and said, ‘So
sorry about your loss, take as much time as you need,”Mr. Altchek said.
Then, several days later, he noticed Mr. Pavelski tweet a link to Medium, a popular blog for
cathartic, personal essays. In a post titled, “How to Lose Your Mind and Build a Treehouse,” Mr.
Pavelski wrote about feeling burned out at work and wanting to rebuild a childhood treehouse as
therapy. The first line read, “I said that I was leaving town for a funeral, but I lied.”
“I was sort of taken aback,” Mr. Althchek said. “It’s not acceptable to be lied to.”
In a disciplinary meeting the next day, Mr. Pavelski’s supervisor acknowledged that he had been
working grueling hours, so he was given another chance. Still, Mr. Altchek wanted to send a
message. “Our feedback to him was, ‘This is not a three-strike policy, it’s a two-strike policy,”
he said.
Mr. Pavelski is still on his first strike. But even in an office that is tolerant of youthful boundary
pushing, some millennial behavior can cross the line. [….]
A sense of entitlement is not the only stereotype attached to millennials in the workplace.

“Entitled, lazy, narcissistic and addicted to social media,” according to CNBC. “They Don’t
Need Trophies but They Want Reinforcement,” Forbes wrote. “Many millennials want to make
the world a better place, and the future of work lies in inspiring them,” Fast Company
proclaimed. [….]
Joan Kuhl, 36, who founded Why Millennials Matter, a consulting firm that advises employers
like Goldman Sachs on hiring and retaining recent college graduates, said that what is needed is
more familiarity. […]
Still, even Ms. Kuhl has been taken aback by some of the millennials in her office. She
remembered an intern who ate a tuna fish sandwich during a 10 a.m. meeting with very senior
colleagues. When mildly rebuked afterward, the intern replied, “Well, you said to be myself, and
I was hungry.”
Perhaps because of this very culture of workplace-as-reality-show, Mr. Pavelski, the
prevaricating treehouse builder, remains notably unchastened.
“Maybe this is because I’m young, but, like, I don’t think that there is a lot about my personal
life that I wouldn’t want to incorporate into what I’m doing professionally,” he said. “The reason
I wrote that essay in the first place was about catharsis, and I wanted to walk through my thought
process and figure out what was going on with me.”
The logic of that may be more apparent to his age group.
“The one thing I don’t want people to mistake is that we’re serious about this,” he added. “And
that we’re taking over. That is all.”

Bagehot said that “one cannot make men good by Act of Parliament”. But then he would, wouldn’t
he? We all know what sort of liberal he was. He was only in favour of the Reform Bill of 1867
because he thought that it would prevent mass democracy and that moderate democracy could be
managed by those of us who know best what is good for others. But Harold Laski, who was almost
a revolutionary, was forever saying that “the state cannot make me happy, but it can prevent me
from being happy”. We are on sounder ground when we legislate to remove obvious obstacles to
human happiness than legislating to make people happy or good. We legislate draconially to
improve road safety marginally, and it took Enoch Powell to put the case powerfully against seatbelts in the name of liberty (without any illusion that the statistical case in favour was other than
strong: he argued that accidental death was terrible, but that loss of liberty was worse). But is
legislation meant to benefit minorities directly and specially, to discriminate in their favour (oddly
called anti-discrimination legislation) analogous? Any answer depends on defining both the
problem and the key concepts carefully.

There used to be an American comic strip called “There Ought to be a Law” in which a small town
busybody demands a law whenever anything shocks, worries or irritates him. He probably invented
“Curb Thy Dog”, “Don’t Litter” and “Report Obscene Matters to Your Postmaster”. He was
invented to parody the spirit behind the old “blue laws” of which the Prohibition Amendment was
only the most famous. Now, of course, he was a right-winger in any context. He first voted for
Hoover. His politics would be Reaganite or Thatcherite today, anti-state, all for private action, but
he is also famously quick – without showing the least awareness of the contradiction – to demand
legislation against anything detestable. Left-wingers want laws of a different kind, but often with
equal unhesitating frequency; and no censorship whatever, of course.

Law is, it is worth recalling, not the only form of social control. Banalities are sometimes hard to
take seriously, but we should try. The rule of law is preferable to individual or group violence, but
there is also tradition, education, example, public opinion, social pressure, enlightened self-interest,
and even satire and ridicule. Satire can be extremely important, even in the minimal sense of mouth
to mouth jokes in regimes where the law sets out to deny any freedom of speech, publication and
assembly to criticise the government – sometimes even prohibiting anything that is not officially
blessed. That Orwell in Animal Farm and in Nineteen Eighty-Four chose the form of satire to argue
that liberty and equality can and must be reconciled was not merely a literary strategy; it came from
a profound belief that the laughter of free men deflates the pompous and the proud, shows Emperors
that they have no clothes other than those we make for them.

Laws need the support of public opinion; but public opinion can, of course, be intolerant, even
oppressive, psychologically and physically; good laws and honest judges are needed to protect
individual rights against some forms of public opinion and behaviour almost as much as against the
state. But such laws are essentially a protection of liberties, constitutional law or protection of the
procedures of public debate, not a prescription of substantive outcomes. Laws too far in advance of

public opinion can stir resentment and prove self-defeating. Under what conditions can law go
further than protection and be a positive enhancement of liberty as an instrument of public policy?
Benevolent autocrats or old-fashioned Communist rulers of one-party states have no doubt. Law is
to moralise and improve the population: freedom is being freed from servitude and superstition. So
laws are then to be interpreted by underlying intentions, not by what is actually written. But a
democratic socialist argument needs to be more subtle because more genuinely libertarian. To the
democratic socialist liberty and equality are not to be confused and are both equally valued. An
enforced equality would be unjust because unfree in principle, and anyway unworkable in practice
and invariably an oppressive and often a bloody debacle when attempted. But liberty for the poor is,
indeed, hideously restricted, not merely by their life-chances but in clearly measurable and
dramatically different life-expectancies. Therefore the quality and quantity of liberty will be
enhanced the more egalitarian a country can become, if it becomes so in a voluntary and widely
acceptable manner. But if either “liberty” or “equality” is made the sole criterion of public policy,
the result is injustice.

When I was young, there seemed to be never a childbirth, or a burst appendix, or any other drastic
physical event that did not occur simultaneously with a snowstorm. The roads would be closed,
there was no question of digging out a car anyway, and some horses had to be hitched up to make
their way into town to the hospital. It was just lucky that there were horses still around – in the
normal course of events they would have been given up, but the war and the gas rationing had
changed all that, at least for the time being.

AG

When the pain in my side struck, therefore, it had to do so at about eleven o’clock at night, and a
blizzard had to be blowing, and since we were not stabling any horses at the moment, the
neighbours’ team had to be brought into action to take me to the hospital. A trip of no more than a
mile and a half but an adventure all the same. The doctor was waiting, and to nobody’s surprise he
prepared to take out my appendix.

Did more appendixes have to be taken out then? I know it still happens, and it is necessary – I even
know of somebody who died because it did not happen soon enough – but as I remember it was a
kind of rite that quite a few people my age had to undergo, not in large numbers by any means but
not all that unexpectedly, and perhaps not all that unhappily, because it meant a holiday from school
and it gave you some kind of status – set you apart, briefly, as one touched by the wing of mortality,
all at a time in your life when that could be gratifying.

Then I went back to school, and enjoyed being excused from physical training for longer than
necessary, and one Saturday morning when my mother and I were alone in the kitchen she told me
that my appendix had been taken out in the hospital, just as I thought, but it was not the only thing
removed. The doctor had seen fit to take it out while he was at it, but the main thing that concerned
him was a growth. A growth, my mother said, the size of a turkey’s egg.

So I lay, minus my appendix, for some days looking out a hospital window at the snow sifting in a
somber way through some evergreens. I don’t suppose it ever crossed my head to wonder how my
father was going to pay for this distinction. (I think he sold a woodlot that he had kept when he
disposed of his father’s farm. He would have hoped to use it for trapping or sugaring. Or perhaps he
felt an unmentionable nostalgia.)

But don’t worry, she said, it’s all over now.

35

The thought of cancer never entered my head and she never mentioned it. I don’t think there could
be such a revelation today without some kind of question, some probing about whether it was or it
wasn’t. Cancerous or benign – we would want to know at once. The only way I can explain our
failure to speak of it was that there must have been a cloud around that word like the cloud around
the mention of sex. Worse, even. […]

So I did not ask and wasn’t told and can only suppose it was benign or was most skillfully got rid
of, for here I am today. And so little do I think of it that all through my life when called upon to list
my surgeries, I automatically say or write “Appendix.”

Evan Walters and the ‘totality of vision’

IM

D – ARTISTICO

Born in Wales in the same year as Hitchens, Evan Walters (1893–1951) was a far less well-known
contemporary. They were both enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools around 1914 and both lived
in Hampstead in the 1920s and 1930s, although no evidence has emerged that they communicated.
Walters is now obscure, but was successful and widely known during the early phase of his career
between the wars, particularly for his depictions of working class Welsh life and society portraits.
He was enthusiastically championed by no less a figure than Augustus John who arranged a solo
exhibition for him in London, which received wide press coverage. John also wrote a flattering
article on Walters for American Vogue in 1927 and may have helped him to secure prestigious
portrait commissions.

AG

As a rather conventional social realist and society portraitist Walters might be all but forgotten were
it not for a revelation he had one evening in 1936 when relaxing by the fire. He noticed when
looking into the flames that his boot, interposed between him and the fire, had the characteristic
doubled appearance associated with physiological diplopia, or ‘double vision’. The experience
alerted Walters not just to double vision, but also to the indistinct properties of the peripheral field.

15

The revelation changed Walters’s life and his fortunes, but not necessarily for the better. He
immediately began an intensive study of these visual phenomena, and the effects can be seen clearly
in Stout Man with Jug c.1936. Here the focus is on the central area, the man’s face, while doubled
images flank his nose, which must have been the artist’s point of fixation. Objects are rendered with
increasingly large horizontal brush strokes as the painting approaches the edges in an evocation of
the relative indistinctness of the peripheral visual field. Within a short time he had produced a
substantial body of work, which was exhibited in London in 1936. Again it received wide attention;
his ‘double vision’ method was featured in a Pathé newsreel in early 1937, which would have
circulated nationally. But the show was a commercial disaster. None of the works sold, and
although Walters pursued his visual researches for the rest of his life, he did so in the face of
increasing indifference from collectors and critics.

Besides the many paintings scattered throughout museums and private collections that record
Walters’s tenacious struggle to capture what he called the ‘totality of vision’, a number of writings
detailing his motives and methods have, fortunately, survived. He published a series of articles in
1940 for the popular magazine the Artist (all titled ‘Vision and the Artist’), which were a distillation
of a longer manuscript he had prepared on his ideas, which remains unpublished. It is also fortunate
that his partner in later life, Erna Meinel, was a persistent and articulate advocate, and continued to
preserve and disseminate his work long after his death. Walters’s own writings and an article and
unpublished manuscript by Meinel reveal a well-informed understanding of visual perception that
underpins a detailed theory of artistic depiction. Both Walters and Meinel were clear about the

historical significance of Walters’s discovery. In his words: ‘in vision itself little advancement
has been made since the adoption of perspective by artists some centuries ago. Consequently all
pictures in existence, without exception, are painted as though their creators had only one eye in
their heads, similar to a Cyclops’.

AT
T

35

Even if he overstated his case, he was broadly right. With the possible exceptions of Cézanne
(whose example Walters came to admire), Bonnard and Giacometti, very few artists had even
tried, let alone found a successful way to represent the binocular aspects of visual experience in a
two-dimensional image. Not only had Walters done this with some success, he had also tackled
the complex and elusive contents of the peripheral visual field, and his obsession with conveying
the actuality of visual experience even led him to include his own semi-transparent nose in
various compositions of the 1940s, such as Still Life with Cricket Ball 1940. Other than the
illustration of the view of his own body used by Ernst Mach in Analysis of Sensations of 1897,
this seems to have been an unprecedented artistic act, and almost completely revoked the
pictorial conventions imposed five centuries earlier by Alberti’s window metaphor.

“Important works of art are those which are considered to be by important artists. There are no
intrinsic criteria as reliable as the authentication of the painting as the work of an artist who is
well-known, great, important and so forth. The same painting, when found to be not the work
of a great author but by a minor figure, may lose almost all its value.” (Germaine Greer, The
Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work, Tauris Parke, London,
2001).
Discuss the quotation and express your personal views by referring to artists that you know in a
