There’s plenty of hope for Neets. I should know – I was one
As an Irish Traveller I left school at 11, but now, after a university degree, I help disengaged young
people. The services and support on offer need an overhaul

Official figures released today show that more than one in 10 young people in the UK are not in
education, employment or training (Neet). There are 407,000 young women who are Neet, and for a while
I was one of them. Now I’m using my experience to help others like me find work.
I left school at 11 with no qualifications. Brought up in a family of Irish Travellers in London, this is what
most people my age did. The schools I attended did not understand or appreciate my ethnicity. I was
stereotyped. Their view that all Irish Travellers were bare-knuckle boxers or antisocial meant me and my
siblings were made to sit in the dinner hall during playtime because we were “too streetwise” in case we
played too hard with the other children.
I largely missed out on secondary school education, so, while others learned fractions or English history I
looked after my younger brothers and learned to keep a home. I had such a negative experience with the
non-travellers in the little time I did have in secondary school that I spent my teenage years only engaging
with people from the Gypsy or Travelling community.
I went back into education at 16 and studied functional skills, English and Maths before applying for and
completing an NVQ in childhood studies. I began campaigning at the London Gypsy and Traveller Unit
to raise awareness of the barriers Gypsies and Irish Travellers face in accessing and sustaining
mainstream education. During this time I completed an access course and went on to become the first
person in my family to go to university. I graduated in 2014 with a first class degree in youth and
community work.
In my final year of university I began working at the Really Neet Project and, at 28, I am now the joint
director. Every day I meet people with low aspirations and barriers that prevent them achieving their
dreams. Homelessness, substance misuse, lone parenting and mental health problems are all
commonplace. Our work aims to empower each individual and help them to break down those barriers,
before supporting them to gain qualifications and jobs. We offer support such as spending the day finding
them accommodation or applying for a birth certificate with them, so they have the proof needed to apply
for benefits or work.
I have realised that I can use my experience to empower young people. Having been in their shoes, I can
relate to them in a way that jobcentres cannot. In return, they see me as proof that it is possible to
overcome their challenges. By building a relationship with each young person, we can understand the
issues they face and give them personalised support. The service we provide has been really successful
and this week I won the Young Women’s Trust’s “influencer” award for my work.
Working with society’s disengaged Neet young people, I have learned that we have to be flexible in our
approach, personalise our support to each individual and recognise that no two young people are the
same. Policymakers should avoid restrictive policies, like the cut to education funding for those aged 19
and older, that indirectly discriminates against those who are most isolated – the people I work with.
Policies like this fail to understand that everyone is different and not all those aged 19-plus are job-ready.
It only creates more barriers for young people trying to get work.
I know how tough it can be not to have qualifications and feel like you have no career options. But I’ve
seen how much young people can achieve when given the right support – and I am a living testament

to that. Like me, most of the 407,000 Neet young women want to get qualified and find jobs. Helping
these young women back into work, education and training would make a huge difference both to them
and to the economy. Let’s rethink the services on offer for young people and give them the support they
need.

Churchill was the only British politician of the twentieth century to become an enduring national hero. In
a sense this was no accident. From youth onwards he was possessed by the ambition to be a great military
hero, like his ancestor the first duke of Marlborough, and a great democratic hero, like his idealized
father, Lord Randolph Churchill. In his more exalted moods he imagined that he was a man of destiny,
intended by Providence to play a heroic role on the stage of history. As he remarked to Asquith’s
daughter Violet, at their first meeting in 1906 ‘“We are all worms. But I do believe that I am a glowworm.”’ That night she burst into her father’s room with the news that for the first time in her life she had
encountered genius. “Well”, Asquith replied, “Winston would certainly agree with you there – but I am
not sure you will find many others of the same mind.”1 His dry comment set the scene for decades of
conflict between Churchill’s heroic self-image, communicated to the world through a stupendous barrage
of publicity in which oratory, journalism, and history were all pressed into service, and the hard-bitten
observations of politicians, civil servants, and military men, conversing in their clubs after another
difficult day with Winston.
Between 1900, when he was first elected to the House of Commons, and 1940, when he succeeded
Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister, Churchill’s career was one of snakes and ladders. The longest of
the snakes was Gallipoli, the ill-starred campaign that all but destroyed his career in 1915. In the eyes of
many observers at the time it was a disaster that epitomized his weaknesses and flaws. All but the most
hostile conceded that he possessed great abilities, remarkable eloquence, a streak of genius and some of
the more amiable qualities of a mischievous schoolboy. But it was almost universally agreed that he was a
shameless egotist, an opportunist without principles or convictions, an unreliable colleague, an erratic
policy-maker who lacked judgement, and a reckless amateur strategist with a dangerous passion for war
and bloodshed. Trade unionists and Labour politicians added that he was a class warrior of obsolete and
reactionary views. “The true tragedy of Mr Churchill”, wrote one critic in 1931, “is that whilst he has in
reality nothing to offer the genuine Labour man or Liberal, he fails to command the confidence of the
genuine Conservative. For the ghosts of the Gallipoli dead will always rise up to damn him anew in times
of national emergency …”2
1940, Britain’s “finest hour”, was the longest of the ladders which restored Churchill’s fortunes. The
transformation was all the more astonishing because it was so unexpected. A politician who had at one
time or another offended every party and faction became the embodiment of national unity, an uncrowned
king whose charisma threatened to eclipse the monarchy. A man who had been written off as too
dangerous and irresponsible for the premiership, and most dangerous of all in wartime, was acclaimed as
the greatest war leader and statesman since Chatham. No less surprising was the fact that his heroic status
outlived the glory days of 1940 and survived the string of disasters which followed in 1941 and 1942. In
1943 the historian A. L. Rowse dedicated his book The Spirit of English History to “Winston S.
Churchill: Historian, Statesman, Saviour of his Country”.3 It was not a controversial judgement. [….]
Churchill’s fortunes, like those of other politicians, depended as much on the person he was thought to be,
and the things he was thought to have done, as upon realities. Furthermore he was such an extraordinary
character that everything about him was heightened and magnified. Wherever he appeared he cast
fantastic shadows, a distorting effect that laid him open to myth-making of both a negative and a positive
kind. Indeed there grew up in Churchill’s lifetime two contrasting and incompatible mythologies. The

They departed, the gods, on the day of the strange tide. All morning under a milky sky the waters in the
bay had swelled and swelled, rising to unheard-of heights, the small waves creeping over parched sand
that for years had known no wetting save for rain and lapping the very bases of the dunes. The rusted hulk
of the freighter that had run aground at the far end of the bay longer ago than any of us could remember
must have thought it was being granted a relaunch. I would not swim again, after that day. The seabirds
mewled and swooped, unnerved, it seemed, by the spectacle of that vast bowl of water bulging like a
blister, lead-blue and malignantly agleam. They looked unnaturally white, that day, those birds. The
waves were depositing a fringe of soiled yellow foam along the waterline. No sail marred the high
horizon. I would not swim, no, not ever again.
Someone has just walked over my grave. Someone.
The name of the house is the Cedars, as of old. A bristling clump of those trees, monkey-brown with a
tarry reek, their trunks nightmarishly tangled, still grows at the left side, facing across an untidy lawn to
the big curved window of what used to be the living room but which Miss Vavasour prefers to call, in
landladyese, the lounge. The front door is at the opposite side, opening on to a square of oil-stained gravel
behind the iron gate that is still painted green, though rust has reduced its struts to a tremulous filigree. I
am amazed at how little has changed in the more than fifty years that have gone by since I was last here.
Amazed, and disappointed, I would go so far as to say appalled, for reasons that are obscure to me, since
why should I desire change, I who have come back to live amidst the rubble of the past? I wonder why
the house was built like that, sideways-on, turning a pebble-dashed windowless white end-wall to the
road; perhaps in former times, before the railway, the road ran in a different orientation altogether,
passing directly in front of the front door, anything is possible. Miss V. is vague on dates but thinks a
cottage was first put up here early in the last century, I mean the century before last, I am losing track of
the millennia, and then was added on to haphazardly over the years. That would account for the jumbled
look of the place, with small rooms giving on to bigger ones, and windows facing blank walls, and low
ceilings throughout. The pitchpine floors sound a nautical note, as does my spindle-backed swivel chair. I
imagine an old seafarer dozing by the fire, landlubbered at last, and the winter gale rattling the window
frames. Oh, to be him. To have been him.
When I was here all those years ago, in the time of the gods, the Cedars was a summer house, for rent by
the fortnight or the month. During all of June each year a rich doctor and his large, raucous family
infested it –we did not like the doctor’s loud-voiced children, they laughed at us and threw stones from
behind the unbreachable barrier of the gate –and after them a mysterious middle-aged couple came, who
spoke to no one, and grimly walked their sausage dog in silence at the same time every morning down
Station Road to the strand. August was the most interesting month at the Cedars, for us. The tenants then
were different each year, people from England or the Continent, the odd pair of honeymooners whom we
would try to spy on, and once even a fit-up troupe of itinerant theatre people who were putting on an
afternoon show in the village’s galvanised-tin cinema. And then, that year, came the family Grace.
The first thing I saw of them was their motor car, parked on the gravel inside the gate. It was a low-slung,
scarred and battered black model with beige leather seats and a big spoked polished wood steering wheel.
Books with bleached and dog-eared covers were thrown carelessly on the shelf under the sportily raked
back window, and there was a touring map of France, much used. The front door of the house stood wide
open, and I could hear voices inside, downstairs, and from upstairs the sound of bare feet running on

Why Andy Warhol still surprises, 30 years after his death
This week marked 30 years since Andy Warhol’s death, but the artist still manages to intrigue us from the
grave, especially with his time capsules packed full of objects

During the last 13 years of his life, Andy Warhol made 610 time capsules. The artist stuffed these parcels
with found objects and everyday ephemera, before consigning them to storage.
When the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh started to carefully exhume and catalogue their contents,
they discovered that the boxes contained everything from newspaper articles, junk mail and toenail
clippings, through to source photographs for projects, letters for commissions, and even the occasional
unsold artwork. The last intact time capsule was opened in 2014 by an anonymous bidder who paid
$30,000 (£24,000) for the privilege. It seems safe to say that, 30 years on from his unexpected death at the
age of 58 in 1987, Warhol’s work still has secrets to reveal.
This is despite the fact that Warhol has become one of the most well known artists in the world, with
endless books and essays devoted to him. His early paintings of the ubiquitous Campbell’s soup cans and
iconic silkscreen images of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe are now instantly recognisable. Warhol
currently enjoys an enviable combination of popular appeal, market success and critical recognition. His
work is widely agreed to hold an important – and, if anything, growing – place in histories of post-1945
artistic production.
The latter status stems in particular from Warhol’s experimentation in avant-garde film, with works like
Sleep (1963), Blow Job (1963) and Empire (1964). Sleep, famously, has a running time of 521 minutes,
and consists of long take footage that shows Warhol’s friend and sometime lover John Giorno sleeping.
To make the film, Warhol combined 22 shots, during each of which he homed in on different parts of
Giorno’s supine form, from his face to his buttocks. The result is an obsessively voyeuristic film, the
overtly boring quality of which paradoxically underlines the intense fascination that the object of desire
can hold for an observer.
The cast lists for Warhol’s films, many of which were made at The Factory – the name Warhol gave his
New York studio – read like a who’s who of the city’s alternative art scene in the 1960s and 1970s. They
feature figures from the worlds of avant-garde film, performance and literature such as Jack Smith, Jill
Johnston, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Gerard Malanga and Taylor Mead. The Factory itself
performed an important networking function, becoming a place for people to be seen as much as for work
to be made. […]
Warhol’s experimentation also expanded into performance. Between 1966 and 1967 he organised a series
of multimedia events in collaboration with the Velvet Underground and Nico under the name Exploding
Plastic Inevitable (EPI). The EPI immersed its audiences in frenetic environments of slide projections,
sound, and strobe lighting. These sensory assaults were disorientating and destabilising, and have come to
be understood as radical uses of technology and media.
In a very different instance of artistic collaboration, Warhol let the groundbreaking choreographer Merce
Cunningham use his work Silver Clouds (1966) as the scenography for Cunningham’s 1968 dance
RainForest. Silver Clouds consists of pillow-shaped Mylar balloons filled with helium that gently float
around any given space. In RainForest, the dancers have to negotiate their unpredictable trajectories. The

Silver Clouds were themselves developed in conjunction with the engineer Billy Klüver, who headed up
the organisation Experiments in Art and Technology during the 1960s.
It is partly this openness to experimentation and collaboration that continues to ensure critical interest in
Warhol, but his engagement with sexuality and gender is equally significant. The essays in the 1996 book
Pop Out: Queer Warhol exemplify the ways in which Warhol’s work itself, together with his
performance of his artistic identity, have had significant ramifications for understandings of the body,
queer art histories and sexual politics.
Warhol’s reputation has not been unassailable. A dip in the art market in the 1990s led to prices for his
works falling, while accusations of misattribution have been levelled at the Andy Warhol Foundation. Yet
three decades on from his death, it often seems as if there are as many versions of Warhol as there are
audiences.
While it might be the success of his works at auction that make headlines, it is the ideas, creative
provocations, and the artist’s own studied resistance to interpretation throughout his interviews and
writings which ensure that audiences remain intrigued.
