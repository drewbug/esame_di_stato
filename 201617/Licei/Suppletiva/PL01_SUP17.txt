Teenagers are not that Internet savvy
Young people are easily duped when evaluating information on social media
Think your teens are internet savvy? Think again. The Stanford History Education Group (SHEG)
published research last November which looked at how capable teens aged 11-18 were of evaluating the
reliability of online sources.
5

According to the executive summary, “our ‘digital natives’ may be able to flit between Facebook and
Twitter while simultaneously uploading a selfie to Instagram and texting a friend”.
“But when it comes to evaluating information that flows through social media channels, they are easily
duped.”
The bar was not set high for what the researchers call “civic online reasoning”. They wanted to know
whether middle-schoolers could distinguish between an advertisement and a news story. They couldn’t.

10

They wanted to know whether high school students would be able to evaluate the reliability of a claim
made on a photosharing website about the consequences of nuclear fallout. They weren’t.
And finally, they wanted to know whether college students who spend hours every day online could see
that the fact that a tweet came from a heavily ideological source might raise questions about bias. They
couldn’t. […]

15

Fake news
There was a huge upsurge in interest in the impact of “fake news” in the US presidential elections, but
this research shows a deeper problem. Fake news stories can mostly be spotted by anyone not completely
blinded by partisanship.

20

25

30

“Native advertising”, or content that is sponsored but designed to look like news stories, is much harder to
identify. For example, in the SHEG study, more than 80 per cent of students believed that an online
article identified by the words “sponsored content” was a real news story, even when they understood the
term.
The students were shown a Slate.com home page featuring a traditional advertisement, a news story and
an article with the headline, “The real reasons women don’t go into tech”. The latter was clearly labelled
as sponsored content, but this made no difference to four out of five of the young students.
The older students did not fare much better. Students aged 14-18 were shown a photograph of allegedly
mutant daisies with the claim that the mutations resulted from the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. They were asked whether the photograph, which was distributed
widely after being uploaded to Imgur photosharing website, constituted strong evidence for the poster’s
claim that the daisies were suffering from “nuclear birth defects”. More than 80 per cent of the students
failed to give solid reasons why the claim might be questionable. (In fact, while in theory it could be due
to radiation, it is possible to find the same kind of mutations in your own garden.) […]

Murky area
Are our Irish young people likely to have much higher levels of digital literacy?

While establishing the reliability of sources is important, internet advertising is a particularly murky area.
Recently, the London Times published an article about a social media agency, Social Chain, that employs
100 young people whose average age is 21. They have bought up social media accounts with huge
numbers of followers and use them to advertise. Most young people have no idea that they are being
targeted in this way. When Social Chain employees were challenged by a Disney executive to make
Disney trend on Twitter, they managed to dominate UK Twitter for hours with
#DisneyScenesIWillNeverGetOver. The people reminiscing about the death of Bambi’s mother would
have had no idea that they had just been manipulated by social media mavens.
Using popular social media accounts to manipulate young people into parting with their parents’ cash is
one thing, but there is another impact that is much harder to quantify – the fact that the internet shapes
more than buying patterns.
It also promotes a world view simply by repetition.
Just as it conditions people into viewing themselves as consumers, it conditions them to accept a
particular worldview uncritically.

50

At the same time, heavy internet usage appears to promote political passivity, except in rare cases,
because “liking” or retweeting takes so much less effort than getting out there and doing something.
The term used by SHEG, civic online reasoning, is a clunky phrase describing an essential skill. But the
scary thought is that the observed lack of it in young people is not likely to change when they eventually
become adults.

The last two decades have seen many significant events in the development of the European Union (EU)
that have provided various opportunities to ponder its future and that of the European integration process
more generally. An almost continuous process of treaty and institutional reform has encouraged ideas of
how the EU should and might look in the future; enlargement has provoked thoughts about the challenges
and opportunities of a much larger membership and also on how far the EU could and should expand. In
2007 – a tumultuous year in which the EU enlarged to include Bulgaria and Romania and entered its
latest round of ‘constitutional’ reform producing the Treaty of Lisbon – this trend continued. As the
saying goes, in EU matters, change has been the only constant in recent times.
Yet 2007, with the fiftieth anniversary of the signing in Rome on 25 March 1957 of the Treaty
Establishing a European Economic Community, was notable in a different way too. This ‘birthday’
provided an opportunity to reflect on the history of the EU and, in particular, of its supranational core, the
European Community; to reflect on its successes and failures, its strengths and weaknesses, the
opportunities taken and those missed, and on the forces and figures that have helped shape what is now a
prominent feature of contemporary European and, increasingly, more broadly international affairs. That
such an anniversary was actually taking place would come as a surprise to the cartoonist who provided
the cover drawing for The Economist of 20 March 1982 that marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Treaty of Rome. It depicted a tombstone dedicated to the EEC with the inscription ‘born March 25, 1957,
moribund March 25, 1982’ and the epitaph ‘Capax imperii nisi imperasset’ – ‘It seemed capable of power
until it tried to wield it’. By contrast, the EU today certainly has power – economic, legal, and political –
and does wield it, albeit not always successfully and effectively and as widely as some of its advocates
might wish. Its opponents, by contrast, may long for its demise, but despite all manner of supposed
‘crises’, it continues to exist, to expand what it does and to enlarge its membership. It is far from
moribund; it is a live entity, settled for some, contested for others.
With the EU therefore a well-established, if not universally loved, fixture of the European political scene
the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of what is more commonly referred to as the ‘Treaty of Rome’ was
something that deserved to be noted, for some even celebrated. Certainly celebration was in the minds of
many of the heads of government and of state and others who attended the high profile, but informal,
gathering of EU leaders in Berlin on 25 March 2007 and oversaw the adoption of the so-called Berlin
Declaration. Not that there was a willingness on the part of all the participants to sign the declaration.
This was left to the presidents of the Commission, Council and European Parliament. But few if any
could deny at least a certain sense of achievement. According to the declaration, ‘European unification’
had brought peace and prosperity to Europe. It had also brought about ‘a sense of community’ and
allowed member states to ‘overcome differences’ and to help ‘unite Europe and to strengthen democracy
and the rule of law’.

EU leaders were not alone in using the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome to reflect
on what had been achieved since 1957. Euro-enthusiasts held commemorative events, as did the EU’s
own institutions and some of its various other bodies. An EU-sponsored logo – together@50 – was
adopted. In France a dedicated website (www.traitederome.fr) on the events of 50 years ago was
established. In London, Chatham House commissioned a celebratory etching. There was some media
interest too with various radio and TV channels broadcasting dedicated programmes and some
newspapers and news magazines setting aside space to record the events of 50 years ago. Academics and
practitioners also got involved, some contributing to special issues of journals, books or other
commemorative publications. Others gathered to discuss the merits and lessons of the last 50 years of
European integration. […]

Where Ramon worked washing dishes, the owner called him in one day and said that he was raising him
to busboy. Ramon would wear the short red jacket and black trousers. Ramon’s hands were cracked and
peeling from the hot water, but he was wary of the promotion because the owner was selling it to him like
there was a catch. They were all foreigners—the owner, the owner’s wife, and the people who came there
to eat. Big people with loud voices and bad manners. You are in the waiting pool now, my friend, and on
a good night your share could be thirty, forty dollars, under the table.
On Sunday morning, Ramon took the bus upstate to see Leon. They talked through the phones. I don’t
know why he wants to see my certificate, Ramon said.
What certificate?

10

Of my birth.
He wants to make sure you’re an American, Leon said.

When Ramon presented his birth certificate, they sat down with him in the back after the restaurant was
closed for the night—Borislav, the owner, his wife, she of the squinting eyes, and another man, who was
fat, like Borislav, but older and with a briefcase in his lap. He was the one who asked the questions. After
Ramon gave his answers, they talked among themselves. He heard harsh mouthfuls of words with deep
notes—it was not a mellifluous language like the bright bubbling of water over rocks of his language.
And then, with a flourish, the owner placed on the table a photograph. Look, my friend, he said. The
photograph was of a girl, a blonde with sunglasses propped in her hair. Her hand gripping the strap of her
shoulder bag was closed like a fist. She wore jeans. […]
How much? Leon said.
A thousand. Plus air and hotel expenses.
They are messing with you. This is good for three thousand, minimum.
And then?

25

Why not? It will pay for filmmaker’s school. Isn’t that what you want?
I don’t know. It’s selling yourself. And it’s a defilement of sacred matters . […]
You sell yourself washing dishes, little bro. This is the country of selling yourself. And what sacred
matter do you mean, which this scam bears no resemblance to, if you think about it?

30

When the plane landed, Ramon crossed himself. He took the bus to the city. It was already late afternoon
and the city was under the heavy dark clouds he had flown through. Packs of motorcycles and mopeds
kept pace with the bus and then shot past. Linked streetcars ground around corners and disappeared as if
swallowed. It was an old European city of unlighted streets and stone buildings with shuttered windows.

The girl from the picture gave him a quick glance of appraisal and nodded. No smile this time. And her
hair was different—pulled tight and bound at the neck. She was dressed for the occasion in a white suit
jacket with a matching short skirt and white shoes with heels that made her taller than Ramon. She
seemed fearful. A bearded heavyset fellow held her elbow.
They all rode in a taxi to a photographer’s studio. The photographer stood Ramon and the girl in an
alcove with potted palms on either side of them and a plastic stained-glass window lit from behind by a
floodlamp. They faced a lectern. When Ramon’s shoulder accidentally brushed hers, the girl jumped as if
from an electric shock.
Some sort of city functionary married them. He mumbled and his eyes widened as if he were having
trouble focusing. He was drunk. When the photographer’s flash went off behind him he lost his place in
his book and had to start again. He swayed, and nearly knocked over the lectern. He clearly didn’t
understand the situation because when he pronounced them man and wife he urged them to kiss. The girl
laughed as she turned away and ran to the heavyset fellow and kissed him.
The photographer placed a bouquet of flowers in the girl’s arms and posed her with Ramon for the formal
wedding picture. And that was that. Ramon was dropped off at the hotel and the next day he flew home.

He learned the girl’s name when the lawyer with the briefcase put in front of him the petition to bring her

One step beyond
At 22, Richard Long changed the face of British sculpture. Yet his works are as simple as a track in the
snow or a stone circle – left to nature and passersby. As Tate Britain brings his art indoors, he tells Sean
O'Hagan how walking has inspired his life's work.

5

10

Back in 1964, when Richard Long was 18, he went for a walk on the downs near his native Bristol. The
countryside was covered in snow, and faced with a pristine expanse of silent whiteness, he began rolling a
snowball through it. When the snowball became too big to push any further, Long took out his camera.
He did not take a snapshot of the giant snowball; instead, he photographed the dark meandering track it
had left in the snow. The ensuing image, one of his earliest works of what is now called land art, is named
Snowball Track. Pure and simple. And, in its purity and simplicity, it denoted all that would follow.
Back then, Long was a student at the West of England College of Art in Bristol, which he describes as "a
provincial and conservative place". Soon after his walk in the snow, the college authorities summoned his
parents to a meeting and told them that he was being dismissed from the course. They also instructed him
not to have any further contact with the other students, even out of college hours.
He tells me this matter-of-factly in his oddly deadpan way, albeit with a hint of mischievous pride. Was
he, I ask, a student radical, a troublemaker? "God, no," he says, laughing. "I was anything but. I was
quiet, quite shy. My dismissal certainly wasn't down to any revolutionary tendencies on my part."

15

20

25

30

What was it about, then? "The work. I was too precocious for them even though I was quiet. The work
troubled them. They thought it provocative." He shakes his head in bemusement and smiles. "It was more
than that, though," he says, after one of the long thoughtful pauses that punctuate his quick bursts of
nervous speech. "They also took my parents in and told them they thought I was quite mad. That was
really my first big break as an artist."
Forty-five years later, Richard Long is preparing for a big, long-overdue show of his land art at Tate
Britain. Entitled Heaven and Earth, it will include sculptures, mud works, photographs and text pieces;
slate circles, straight lines of stones, wall markings made with mud from the River Avon, as well as
photographic and written documentation of his wanderings over the earth. (It is not a retrospective; even
Tate Britain is not big enough for that.) At the exhibition's heart, though, will be the act of walking.
"All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking," wrote Nietzsche. Richard Long's great thought while
walking was to make his walking into his art. In an illuminating catalogue essay for Heaven and Earth,
Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, writes, "In A Line Made by Walking (1967), a work made at the age
of 22, Long changed our notion of sculpture and gave new meaning to an activity as old as man himself.
Nothing in the history of art quite prepared us for the originality of his action."
A Line Made by Walking exists now only in a photograph. This, too, is part of the iconoclastic nature—
and the imaginative power—of Long's art, that it is often as transient and impermanent as anything in the
natural world around it. The grass has long since grown back over the track he left that day in a field of
wild flowers somewhere in England. It is quite conceivable that no one else actually saw the original
work, or, if they did, recognised it as his, or indeed, as a work of art at all. Likewise, his stone circles in
Connemara or the Andes, which may well have been mistaken for ancient stone circles by passers-by, or,

in some cases, been so vast that people may have walked through them without really noticing them.
"One thing I like about my work is all the different ways it can be in the world," he says. "A local could
walk by and not notice it, or notice it and not know anything about me. Or someone could come upon a
circle and know it was a circle of mine. I really like the notion of the visibility or invisibility of the work
as well as the permanence and transience." […]
