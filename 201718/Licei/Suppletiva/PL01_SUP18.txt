ID2020 and UNHCR Host Joint Workshop on Digital Identity

In 2017, ID2020 and the UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) brought together
representatives from government, public, and private sectors. The multi-stakeholder group discussed
digital identity opportunities and, specifically, a potential pilot project for refugees, forcibly displaced and
stateless persons.

Sixty-five million people — the highest number seen in decades — are displaced due to conflict, drought,
famine, and other factors. The root causes of forced displacement are often deeply stressful, and refugees
may not have had the time or opportunity to obtain or locate essential personal documents before fleeing,
leaving them disproportionately undocumented. Furthermore, many refugees who come from marginalized
and hard-to-reach communities may have never been registered or issued with identity documents.
Similarly, paper-based credentials are likely to be lost or destroyed during displacement.
For the millions fleeing persecution, relying on governments to authenticate their identity, or provide them
with necessary credentials, can be unreliable and often dangerous. Without valid identification documents
from their country of origin and, removed from communities that could provide informal confirmation of
identity, refugees and other displaced persons often find themselves without any officially recognized
source of identification. This lack of recognized identification deprives them of protection, access to
services, and basic rights.
The Sustainable Development Agenda (SDG 16.9) supports the goal of legal identity for all by 2030, and
recognizes its critical importance for the world’s most vulnerable people. […] Inclusion in digitized Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and national identity systems can help to both protect and
empower refugees and realise SDG Target 16.9. [But] Refugees, other forcibly displaced persons and the
stateless are often left out of the CRVS and national identity systems of the countries in which they live.
The births of their children are not registered and they are not issued documentation by host governments.
This lack of legal identity prevents access to both public and private services, increases the risk of
statelessness, and inhibits effective state planning. The increasing digitization of CRVS systems may
exacerbate exclusion by preventing access to the predominant registration system, and as a result to other
services that are dependent on digital CRVS registration records.
Where data protection and privacy standards are met, a broadly recognized digital identity system benefits
all stakeholders. A digital identity can facilitate access to essential services, aid countries in distribution of
social benefits, and open up formal financial tools to the world’s 2 billion unbanked people. Furthermore,
accurate systems of identification are necessary for accountability and governance, and to help ensure that
development aid and protection is directed to those most in need. For refugees and people who are not fully
included in state identity systems, a portable digital identity system can be a step toward regaining their
identity, providing them with self-reliance opportunities, and improving their participation in the social and
economic life of their host community. […]

A multi-stakeholder model is essential for the benefits of a digital identity to be realized. An identity must
be broadly recognized by both the public- and private-sector organizations with which an individual may
interact. […] A multi-stakeholder approach brings together diverse stakeholders to jointly address these
technical and non-technical questions. The collaborative, iterative development of digital identity
technology ensures that the technology developed is relevant, secure and sustainable. And through
transparent governance and the provision of sustainable financing for interoperable identity systems, this
model aligns the diverse incentives of various stakeholders in the identity ecosystem. Moreover, the
approach creates a “network effect” and opens up opportunities to [access] the systems and processes that
public and private organizations already have in place to reach people. […] Ultimately, this model is a
virtuous circle both public and private organizations are able to connect to the people they want to reach,
namely their customers, their beneficiaries, their employees. And through forging that connection,
individuals will have a means of identifying themselves, which better serves them.
Concurrent pilot projects with various partners will provide the strongest foundation for scaled-up
implementation. During the two-day event, participants discussed potential in-country concrete
applications of digital identity, with the intent to run a series of concurrent pilot projects with multiple
partners in 2018. These pilots will provide the information and technical, regulatory and political testing
grounds necessary for efficient scaled-up implementation and will also ensure a participatory approach,
including refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, at each crucial stage of the process.
This is an opportune time to shape a new world where people are empowered and where new solutions can
help alleviate both age-old and contemporary problems. Developing a sustainable digital identity for
refugees, other forcibly displaced persons and the stateless […] is a shared responsibility that can only be
implemented through the concerted action of government, the private sector, UN agencies and the civil
society.

Left governments almost invariably disappoint their supporters because, even when the prosperity which
they have promised is achievable, there is always need of an uncomfortable transition period about which
little has been said beforehand. At this moment we see our own Government, in its desperate economic
straits, fighting in effect against its own past propaganda. The crisis that we are now in is not a sudden
unexpected calamity, like an earthquake, and it was not caused by the war, but merely hastened by it.
Decades ago it could be foreseen that something of this kind was going to happen. Ever since the nineteenth
century our national income, dependent partly on interest from foreign investments, and on assured markets
and cheap raw materials in colonial countries, had been extremely precarious. It was certain that, sooner or
later, something would go wrong and we should be forced to make our exports balance our imports: and
when that happened the British standard of living, including the working-class standard, was bound to fall,
at least temporarily. Yet the left-wing parties, even when they were vociferously anti-imperialist, never
made these facts clear. On occasion they were ready to admit that the British workers had benefited, to
some extent, by the looting of Asia and Africa, but they always allowed it to appear that we could give up
our loot and yet in some way contrive to remain prosperous. Quite largely, indeed, the workers were won
over to Socialism by being told that they were exploited, whereas the brute truth was that, in world terms,
they were exploiters. Now, to all appearances, the point has been reached when the working-class livingstandard cannot be maintained, let alone raised. Even if we squeeze the rich out of existence, the mass of
the people must either consume less or produce more. Or am I exaggerating the mess we are in? I may be,
and I should be glad to find myself mistaken. But the point I wish to make is that this question, among
people who are faithful to the Left ideology, cannot be genuinely discussed. The lowering of wages and
raising of working hours are felt to be inherently anti-Socialist measures and must therefore be dismissed
in advance, whatever the economic situation may be. It is far safer to evade the issue and pretend that we
can put everything right by redistributing the existing income.
To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions. Take for instance the fact that all
sensitive people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of
poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less industrialization, but more and more.
Or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind
of coercion. Or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without having powerful
armed forces. One could multiply examples. In every such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly
plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official ideology. The normal response
is to push the question, unanswered, into a corner of one's mind, and then continue repeating contradictory
catchwords. One does not have to search far through the reviews and magazines to discover the effects of
this kind of thinking.
I am not, of course, suggesting that mental dishonesty is peculiar to Socialists and left-wingers generally,
or is commonest among them. It is merely that acceptance of any political discipline seems to be
incompatible with literary integrity. This applies equally to movements like Pacifism and Personalism,
which claim to be outside the ordinary political struggle. Indeed, the mere sound of words ending in -ism
seems to bring with it the smell of propaganda. Group loyalties are necessary, and yet they are poisonous

to literature, so long as literature is the product of individuals. As soon as they are allowed to have any
influence, even a negative one, on creative writing, the result is not only falsification, but often the actual
drying-up of the inventive faculties.
Well, then what? Do we have to conclude that it is the duty of every writer to ‘keep out of politics’?
Certainly not! In any case, as I have said already, no thinking person can or does genuinely keep out of
politics, in an age like the present one. I only suggest that we should draw a sharper distinction than we do
at present between our political and our literary loyalties, and should recognize that a willingness
to do certain distasteful but necessary things does not carry with it any obligation to swallow the beliefs
that usually go with them.

The bungalow Mrs. Fritts ran as a boarding house was just south of Verona, behind a palm grove that gave
it the look of an oasis. In her neat garden was a twisted tree laden with elongated seed pods: she called it
her cigar tree. The bungalow was furnished with upholstered chairs and carpets with floral designs like
puked fricassees. On most walls were religious mottos, THE LORD WILL PROVIDE and PUT ON THE
WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD, and on one was a coconut carved into a monkey’s face. Mrs. Fritts said there
were “scorpshuns” on the grounds. There were also sheds of various sizes – an ostrich in one, a kangaroo
in another. These animals, and some others I knew only as stinks and night-time coughs, she looked after
for Millsaps Circus, which had its winter quarters in Verona proper. She was a tidy damp-eyed little woman,
seventy-odd, who had ceased to see anything extraordinary in either the animals or the people she boarded,
the circus’s overflow.
Perhaps they weren’t so odd, I decided on my third day. They hadn’t changed, my eye had. I saw them all
over the house, Mr. Biker the dwarf who played “Daisy” on his ocarina and sat on three telephone books
to eat; Orrie, whose hands grew out of his shoulders; the Flying Faffners, Kenny and Doris, who cycled the
high wire --- but they did no tricks here and looked quite colorless hunched over their checkboards. There
was a man called “Digit” Taft, from Giorgia, whose specialty was sticking his finger into the knot-hole of
a horizontal board and kicking himself upright and balancing on that finger: he had a bird tattoo on his
cheek, which flapped when he chewed gum. Harvey and Hornette were bareback riders; there were no
horses in Mrs. Fritts’ sheds; Harvey and Hornette read comic books. They were all very strong: Digit could
tear Mr. Biker’s phone books in half, and Hornette, a pretty girl of about 16, could get the caps off
cherryade1 bottles with her teeth.
The group portrait I did of them, Boarders, was one of my best – another pictorial fluke in available light,
since anyone’s Aunt Fanny could have done the same with a Baby Brownie2.
They are solemn, the seven of them, plus Mrs. Fritts. Orrie is old, Mrs. Fritts in her frilly church dress. They
stand together: it might be a family portrait, a Sunday on a Southern porch, a gathering of the clan in summer
dresses and white suits.
But you miss it entirely unless you linger for a fraction of a second, and having accepted it as a plain family
you are shocked: the nipper is not a nipper, that old man has hands but no arms, the shadow on that other
man’s cheek is a bird tattoo, and those girls, Doris and Hornette, have muscular trapeze artist’s shoulders.
Behind Mrs. Fritts, reflected on the parlor window, is the most bizarre detail, an ostrich, but so faint you
won’t see it until you’ve seen the others. The picture celebrates the unexpected, as one person after the
other is revealed. You accepted it from the first, deceived yourself into thinking you had seen it before. Yet
my object was not to mock or trick the viewer but to hasten his understanding and impel him to look for
more: Digit’s thick finger, Biker’s kindly eyes, Hornette’s shanks, the weary dignity on the face of Mrs.
Fritts, maybe the ostrich. Then it’s a family again. Looking at this picture ought to be like reading a book,
a time exposure, a lesson in seeing. The viewer goes away instructed. Nothing looks the same to him after
that. The world hasn’t changed – he has.
I printed the picture, distributed it, and made eight friends. “you’re the best in the business,” said Hornette.
And Mrs. Fritts said, “I hope you stay here a good long time.”

Same old, same old. How the hipster aesthetic is taking over the world

Go to Shoreditch Grind, near a roundabout in the middle of London’s hipster district. It’s a coffee shop
with rough-hewn wooden tables, plentiful sunlight from wide windows, and austere pendant lighting. Then
head to Takk in Manchester. It’s a coffee shop with a big glass storefront, reclaimed wood furniture, and
hanging Edison bulbs. Compare the two: You might not even know you’re in different spaces.
It’s no accident that these places look similar. Though they’re not part of a chain and don’t have their
interior design directed by a single corporate overlord, these coffee shops have a way of mimicking the
same tired style, a hipster reduction obsessed with a superficial sense of history and the remnants of
industrial machinery that once occupied the neighbourhoods they take over. And it’s not just London and
Manchester – this style is spreading across the world, from Bangkok to Beijing, Seoul to San Francisco.
It’s not just coffee shops, either. Everywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of
looking the same, whether it’s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces. A coffee
roaster resembles a WeWork1 office space. How can all that homogeneity possibly be cool?
In an essay for the American tech website The Verge, I called this style “AirSpace”. It’s marked by an
easily recognisable mix of symbols – like reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting
– that’s meant to provide familiar, comforting surroundings for a wealthy, mobile elite, who want to feel
like they’re visiting somewhere “authentic” while they travel, but who actually just crave more of the same:
more rustic interiors and sans-serif logos and splashes of cliche accent colours on rugs and walls.
Hence the replicability: if a hip creative travels to Berlin or Tallinn, they seek out a place that looks like
AirSpace, perhaps recommending it on Foursquare or posting a photo of it to Instagram to gain the approval
of culturally savvy friends. Gradually, an entire AirSpace geography grows, in which you can travel all the
way around the world and never leave it.
You can hop from cookie-cutter bar to office space to apartment building and be surrounded by those same
AirSpace tropes I described above. You’ll be guaranteed fast internet, strong coffee, and a comfortable
chair from which to do your telecommuting. What you won’t get is anything interesting or actually unique.
There are several causes of AirSpace. The first is that mobility is increasing: more people move more
quickly around the world than ever before, mostly passing through the same urban hotspots (London, New
York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong), and carrying their sense of style with them. It’s globalisation, but
intensified, made more accessible to a wider economic spectrum of people, more of the time. Mobility is
not just for the rich any more: working remotely is increasingly common; you can take a sabbatical to work
from Bali and not miss a beat.
Taste is also becoming globalised, as more people around the world share their aesthetic aspirations on the
same massive social media platforms, whether it’s Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or Foursquare, with their
hundreds of millions or billions of users. As algorithms shape which content we consume on our feeds, we
all learn to desire the same things, which often happens to involve austere interiors, reclaimed wood, and
Edison bulbs, like a metastasised real-life version of Kinfolk magazine or Monocle.

Startups are also growing to provide these experiences of sameness as a product, predicated on the fact that
we now prefer consuming ready-made generic spaces to creating new ones of our own. We’ve been
infantilised. The companies use technology to foster a sense of easy placelessness; Roam, for example, is
an international chain of co-living and working spaces that offers the same lifestyle (and same furniture)
in Madrid, Miami and Ubud, and residents can live anywhere for £1,500 per month. WeWork’s1 WeLive
branch creates wan dormitories for mobile tech workers, each with its own raw-wood furniture and
mandated techno-kitsch interior decorating […]
It’s not just boring aesthetics, however. There’s also the economic divide: access to AirSpace is expensive,
whether it’s a £3 cortado or the rent on a WeLive or Roam apartment. If you can’t afford it, you are shut
out.
AirSpace is convenient, yes. It helps its occupants feel comfortable wherever they are, settled in amid
recognisable reminders that they are relevant, interesting, mobile and global. You can change places within
it with a single click, the same anonymous seamlessness of an airport lounge but distributed everywhere,
behind the facades of local buildings that don’t look like hotels, but act like them.
Yet the discontent of this phenomenon is a creeping anxiety. Is everywhere really starting to look just the
same?
