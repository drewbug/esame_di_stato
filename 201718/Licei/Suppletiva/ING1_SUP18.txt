ID2020 and UNHCR Host Joint Workshop on Digital Identity

In 2017, ID2020 and the UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) brought together
representatives from government, public, and private sectors. The multi-stakeholder group discussed
digital identity opportunities and, specifically, a potential pilot project for refugees, forcibly displaced
and stateless persons.

Sixty-five million people — the highest number seen in decades — are displaced due to conflict, drought,
famine, and other factors. The root causes of forced displacement are often deeply stressful, and refugees
may not have had the time or opportunity to obtain or locate essential personal documents before fleeing,
leaving them disproportionately undocumented. Furthermore, many refugees who come from
marginalized and hard-to-reach communities may have never been registered or issued with identity
documents. Similarly, paper-based credentials are likely to be lost or destroyed during displacement.
For the millions fleeing persecution, relying on governments to authenticate their identity, or provide
them with necessary credentials, can be unreliable and often dangerous. Without valid identification
documents from their country of origin and, removed from communities that could provide informal
confirmation of identity, refugees and other displaced persons often find themselves without any
officially recognized source of identification. This lack of recognized identification deprives them of
protection, access to services, and basic rights.
The Sustainable Development Agenda (SDG 16.9) supports the goal of legal identity for all by 2030, and
recognizes its critical importance for the world’s most vulnerable people. […] Inclusion in digitized Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and national identity systems can help to both protect and
empower refugees and realise SDG Target 16.9. [But] Refugees, other forcibly displaced persons and the
stateless are often left out of the CRVS and national identity systems of the countries in which they live.
The births of their children are not registered and they are not issued documentation by host governments.
This lack of legal identity prevents access to both public and private services, increases the risk of
statelessness, and inhibits effective state planning. The increasing digitization of CRVS systems may
exacerbate exclusion by preventing access to the predominant registration system, and as a result to other
services that are dependent on digital CRVS registration records.
Where data protection and privacy standards are met, a broadly recognized digital identity system benefits
all stakeholders. A digital identity can facilitate access to essential services, aid countries in distribution
of social benefits, and open up formal financial tools to the world’s 2 billion unbanked people.
Furthermore, accurate systems of identification are necessary for accountability and governance, and to
help ensure that development aid and protection is directed to those most in need. For refugees and people
who are not fully included in state identity systems, a portable digital identity system can be a step toward
regaining their identity, providing them with self-reliance opportunities, and improving their participation
in the social and economic life of their host community. […]

A multi-stakeholder model is essential for the benefits of a digital identity to be realized. An identity must
be broadly recognized by both the public- and private-sector organizations with which an individual may
interact. […] A multi-stakeholder approach brings together diverse stakeholders to jointly address these
technical and non-technical questions. The collaborative, iterative development of digital identity
technology ensures that the technology developed is relevant, secure and sustainable. And through
transparent governance and the provision of sustainable financing for interoperable identity systems, this
model aligns the diverse incentives of various stakeholders in the identity ecosystem. Moreover, the
approach creates a “network effect” and opens up opportunities to [access] the systems and processes that
public and private organizations already have in place to reach people. […] Ultimately, this model is a
virtuous circle both public and private organizations are able to connect to the people they want to reach,
namely their customers, their beneficiaries, their employees. And through forging that connection,
individuals will have a means of identifying themselves, which better serves them.
Concurrent pilot projects with various partners will provide the strongest foundation for scaled-up
implementation. During the two-day event, participants discussed potential in-country concrete
applications of digital identity, with the intent to run a series of concurrent pilot projects with multiple
partners in 2018. These pilots will provide the information and technical, regulatory and political testing
grounds necessary for efficient scaled-up implementation and will also ensure a participatory approach,
including refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, at each crucial stage of the process.
This is an opportune time to shape a new world where people are empowered and where new solutions
can help alleviate both age-old and contemporary problems. Developing a sustainable digital identity for
refugees, other forcibly displaced persons and the stateless […] is a shared responsibility that can only be
implemented through the concerted action of government, the private sector, UN agencies and the civil
society.

Left governments almost invariably disappoint their supporters because, even when the prosperity which
they have promised is achievable, there is always need of an uncomfortable transition period about which
little has been said beforehand. At this moment we see our own Government, in its desperate economic
straits, fighting in effect against its own past propaganda. The crisis that we are now in is not a sudden
unexpected calamity, like an earthquake, and it was not caused by the war, but merely hastened by it.
Decades ago it could be foreseen that something of this kind was going to happen. Ever since the
nineteenth century our national income, dependent partly on interest from foreign investments, and on
assured markets and cheap raw materials in colonial countries, had been extremely precarious. It was
certain that, sooner or later, something would go wrong and we should be forced to make our exports
balance our imports: and when that happened the British standard of living, including the working-class
standard, was bound to fall, at least temporarily. Yet the left-wing parties, even when they were
vociferously anti-imperialist, never made these facts clear. On occasion they were ready to admit that the
British workers had benefited, to some extent, by the looting of Asia and Africa, but they always allowed
it to appear that we could give up our loot and yet in some way contrive to remain prosperous. Quite
largely, indeed, the workers were won over to Socialism by being told that they were exploited, whereas
the brute truth was that, in world terms, they were exploiters. Now, to all appearances, the point has been
reached when the working-class living-standard cannot be maintained, let alone raised. Even if we
squeeze the rich out of existence, the mass of the people must either consume less or produce more. Or
am I exaggerating the mess we are in? I may be, and I should be glad to find myself mistaken. But the
point I wish to make is that this question, among people who are faithful to the Left ideology, cannot be
genuinely discussed. The lowering of wages and raising of working hours are felt to be inherently antiSocialist measures and must therefore be dismissed in advance, whatever the economic situation may be.
It is far safer to evade the issue and pretend that we can put everything right by redistributing the existing
income.
To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions. Take for instance the fact that
all sensitive people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of
poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less industrialization, but more and more.
Or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind
of coercion. Or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without having
powerful armed forces. One could multiply examples. In every such case there is a conclusion which is
perfectly plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official ideology. The
normal response is to push the question, unanswered, into a corner of one's mind, and then continue
repeating contradictory catchwords. One does not have to search far through the reviews and magazines
to discover the effects of this kind of thinking.
I am not, of course, suggesting that mental dishonesty is peculiar to Socialists and left-wingers
generally, or is commonest among them. It is merely that acceptance of any political discipline seems to
be incompatible with literary integrity. This applies equally to movements like Pacifism and Personalism,
which claim to be outside the ordinary political struggle. Indeed, the mere sound of words ending in -ism
seems to bring with it the smell of propaganda. Group loyalties are necessary, and yet they are poisonous

to literature, so long as literature is the product of individuals. As soon as they are allowed to have any
influence, even a negative one, on creative writing, the result is not only falsification, but often the actual
drying-up of the inventive faculties.
Well, then what? Do we have to conclude that it is the duty of every writer to ‘keep out of politics’?
Certainly not! In any case, as I have said already, no thinking person can or does genuinely keep out of
politics, in an age like the present one. I only suggest that we should draw a sharper distinction than we
do at present between our political and our literary loyalties, and should recognize that a willingness
to do certain distasteful but necessary things does not carry with it any obligation to swallow the beliefs
that usually go with them.

The bungalow Mrs. Fritts ran as a boarding house was just south of Verona, behind a palm grove that
gave it the look of an oasis. In her neat garden was a twisted tree laden with elongated seed pods: she
called it her cigar tree. The bungalow was furnished with upholstered chairs and carpets with floral
designs like puked fricassees. On most walls were religious mottos, THE LORD WILL PROVIDE and
PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD, and on one was a coconut carved into a monkey’s face. Mrs.
Fritts said there were “scorpshuns” on the grounds. There were also sheds of various sizes – an ostrich in
one, a kangaroo in another. These animals, and some others I knew only as stinks and night-time coughs,
she looked after for Millsaps Circus, which had its winter quarters in Verona proper. She was a tidy
damp-eyed little woman, seventy-odd, who had ceased to see anything extraordinary in either the animals
or the people she boarded, the circus’s overflow.
Perhaps they weren’t so odd, I decided on my third day. They hadn’t changed, my eye had. I saw them all
over the house, Mr. Biker the dwarf who played “Daisy” on his ocarina and sat on three telephone books
to eat; Orrie, whose hands grew out of his shoulders; the Flying Faffners, Kenny and Doris, who cycled
the high wire --- but they did no tricks here and looked quite colorless hunched over their checkboards.
There was a man called “Digit” Taft, from Giorgia, whose specialty was sticking his finger into the knothole of a horizontal board and kicking himself upright and balancing on that finger: he had a bird tattoo
on his cheek, which flapped when he chewed gum. Harvey and Hornette were bareback riders; there were
no horses in Mrs. Fritts’ sheds; Harvey and Hornette read comic books. They were all very strong: Digit
could tear Mr. Biker’s phone books in half, and Hornette, a pretty girl of about 16, could get the caps off
cherryade1 bottles with her teeth.
The group portrait I did of them, Boarders, was one of my best – another pictorial fluke in available light,
since anyone’s Aunt Fanny could have done the same with a Baby Brownie2.
They are solemn, the seven of them, plus Mrs. Fritts. Orrie is old, Mrs. Fritts in her frilly church dress.
They stand together: it might be a family portrait, a Sunday on a Southern porch, a gathering of the clan
in summer dresses and white suits.
But you miss it entirely unless you linger for a fraction of a second, and having accepted it as a plain
family you are shocked: the nipper is not a nipper, that old man has hands but no arms, the shadow on that
other man’s cheek is a bird tattoo, and those girls, Doris and Hornette, have muscular trapeze artist’s
shoulders. Behind Mrs. Fritts, reflected on the parlor window, is the most bizarre detail, an ostrich, but so
faint you won’t see it until you’ve seen the others. The picture celebrates the unexpected, as one person
after the other is revealed. You accepted it from the first, deceived yourself into thinking you had seen it
before. Yet my object was not to mock or trick the viewer but to hasten his understanding and impel him
to look for more: Digit’s thick finger, Biker’s kindly eyes, Hornette’s shanks, the weary dignity on the
face of Mrs. Fritts, maybe the ostrich. Then it’s a family again. Looking at this picture ought to be like
reading a book, a time exposure, a lesson in seeing. The viewer goes away instructed. Nothing looks the
same to him after that. The world hasn’t changed – he has.
I printed the picture, distributed it, and made eight friends. “you’re the best in the business,” said
Hornette. And Mrs. Fritts said, “I hope you stay here a good long time.”

Same old, same old. How the hipster aesthetic is taking over the world

Go to Shoreditch Grind, near a roundabout in the middle of London’s hipster district. It’s a coffee shop
with rough-hewn wooden tables, plentiful sunlight from wide windows, and austere pendant lighting.
Then head to Takk in Manchester. It’s a coffee shop with a big glass storefront, reclaimed wood
furniture, and hanging Edison bulbs. Compare the two: You might not even know you’re in different
spaces.
It’s no accident that these places look similar. Though they’re not part of a chain and don’t have their
interior design directed by a single corporate overlord, these coffee shops have a way of mimicking the
same tired style, a hipster reduction obsessed with a superficial sense of history and the remnants of
industrial machinery that once occupied the neighbourhoods they take over. And it’s not just London and
Manchester – this style is spreading across the world, from Bangkok to Beijing, Seoul to San Francisco.
It’s not just coffee shops, either. Everywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of
looking the same, whether it’s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces. A coffee
roaster resembles a WeWork1 office space. How can all that homogeneity possibly be cool?
In an essay for the American tech website The Verge, I called this style “AirSpace”. It’s marked by an
easily recognisable mix of symbols – like reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial
lighting – that’s meant to provide familiar, comforting surroundings for a wealthy, mobile elite, who
want to feel like they’re visiting somewhere “authentic” while they travel, but who actually just crave
more of the same: more rustic interiors and sans-serif logos and splashes of cliche accent colours on rugs
and walls.
Hence the replicability: if a hip creative travels to Berlin or Tallinn, they seek out a place that looks like
AirSpace, perhaps recommending it on Foursquare or posting a photo of it to Instagram to gain the
approval of culturally savvy friends. Gradually, an entire AirSpace geography grows, in which you can
travel all the way around the world and never leave it.
You can hop from cookie-cutter bar to office space to apartment building and be surrounded by those
same AirSpace tropes I described above. You’ll be guaranteed fast internet, strong coffee, and a
comfortable chair from which to do your telecommuting. What you won’t get is anything interesting or
actually unique.
There are several causes of AirSpace. The first is that mobility is increasing: more people move more
quickly around the world than ever before, mostly passing through the same urban hotspots (London,
New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong), and carrying their sense of style with them. It’s globalisation, but
intensified, made more accessible to a wider economic spectrum of people, more of the time. Mobility is
not just for the rich any more: working remotely is increasingly common; you can take a sabbatical to
work from Bali and not miss a beat.
Taste is also becoming globalised, as more people around the world share their aesthetic aspirations on
the same massive social media platforms, whether it’s Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or Foursquare,
with their hundreds of millions or billions of users. As algorithms shape which content we consume on
our feeds, we all learn to desire the same things, which often happens to involve austere interiors,
reclaimed wood, and Edison bulbs, like a metastasised real-life version of Kinfolk magazine or Monocle.

Startups are also growing to provide these experiences of sameness as a product, predicated on the fact
that we now prefer consuming ready-made generic spaces to creating new ones of our own. We’ve been
infantilised. The companies use technology to foster a sense of easy placelessness; Roam, for example, is
an international chain of co-living and working spaces that offers the same lifestyle (and same furniture)
in Madrid, Miami and Ubud, and residents can live anywhere for £1,500 per month. WeWork’s 1 WeLive
branch creates wan dormitories for mobile tech workers, each with its own raw-wood furniture and
mandated techno-kitsch interior decorating […]
It’s not just boring aesthetics, however. There’s also the economic divide: access to AirSpace is
expensive, whether it’s a £3 cortado or the rent on a WeLive or Roam apartment. If you can’t afford it,
you are shut out.
AirSpace is convenient, yes. It helps its occupants feel comfortable wherever they are, settled in amid
recognisable reminders that they are relevant, interesting, mobile and global. You can change places
within it with a single click, the same anonymous seamlessness of an airport lounge but distributed
everywhere, behind the facades of local buildings that don’t look like hotels, but act like them.
Yet the discontent of this phenomenon is a creeping anxiety. Is everywhere really starting to look just the
same?

“E che cosa leggete, signorina…?” “Oh! Non è che un romanzo!” replica la giovanetta, lasciando
cadere il libro con indifferenza ricercata o con momentanea vergogna. “È Cecilia, o Camilla, o
Belinda” o, per farla breve, non è che un’opera nella quale sono prodigate le più belle facoltà dello
spirito e che offre al mondo, in un linguaggio scelto, la più completa conoscenza della natura
umana, la più felice descrizione delle sue varietà, le più vive manifestazioni di spirito e di brio.
(Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey)
Commenta la citazione facendo riferimento ai testi letterari da te studiati in una delle lingue
straniere. Giustifica le tue affermazioni evidenziando le “facoltà dello spirito” e la “natura umana”
che tali opere hanno esaltato e descritto.

[…] Five blocks along, Fats turned left again, into the first of the streets that made up the Fields. He
loosened his school tie with one hand as he walked, but did not remove it. He did not care that he was,
conspicuously, a schoolboy. Fats had never even attempted to customize his uniform in any way; to
pin badges on his lapels or adjust his tie knot to suit fashion; he wore his school clothes with the
disdain of a convict.

5

He had decided that he possessed traits that were authentic, which ought therefore to be encouraged
and cultivated; but also that some of his habits of thought were the unnatural product of his unfortunate
upbringing, and consequently inauthentic and to be purged. Lately, he had been experimenting with
acting on what he thought were his authentic impulses, and ignoring or suppressing the guilt and fear
(inauthentic) that such actions seemed to engender. Undoubtedly, this was becoming easier with
practice. He wanted to toughen up inside, to become invulnerable, to be free of the fear of
consequences: to rid himself of spurious notions of goodness and badness.

10

One of the things that had begun to irritate him about his own dependence on Andrew was that the
latter’s presence sometimes curbed and limited the full expression of Fats’ authentic self. Somewhere
in Andrew was a self-drawn map of what constituted fair play, and lately Fats had caught looks of
displeasure, confusion and disappointment poorly disguised on his old friend’s face. Andrew pulled up
short at extremes of baiting and derision. Fats did not hold this against Andrew; it would have been
inauthentic for Andrew to join in, unless that was what he really, truly wanted. The trouble was that
Andrew was displaying an attachment to the kind of morality against which Fats was waging an
increasingly determined war. Fats suspected that the right thing to do, the correctly unsentimental act
in pursuit of full authenticity, would have been to cut Andrew adrift; and yet he still preferred
Andrew’s company to anybody else’s.

15

20

Fats was convinced that he knew himself particularly well; he explored the nooks and crevices of his
own psyche with an attention he had recently ceased to give to anything else. He spent hours
interrogating himself about his own impulses, desires and fears, attempting to discriminate between
those that were truly his and those that he had been taught to feel. He examined his own attachments
(nobody else he knew, he was sure, was ever this honest with themselves; they drifted, half asleep,
through life): and his conclusion had been that Andrew, whom he had known since he was five, was
the person for whom he felt the most straightforward affection; that, even though he was now old
enough to see through her, he retained an attachment to his mother that was not his own fault; and that
he actively despised Cubby1, who represented the acme and pinnacle of inauthenticity. On the
Facebook page that Fats curated with a care he devoted to almost nothing else, he had highlighted a
quotation he had found on his parents’ bookshelves:

25

30

I do not want believers, I think I am too malicious to believe in myself ... I have a terrible
fear I shall one day be pronounced holy ... I do not want to be a saint, rather even a buffoon
... perhaps I am a buffoon ...

35

Andrew liked it very much, and Fats liked how impressed he was. [...]

Fats was curiously joyless these days, even though he made everybody else laugh as much as ever. His
quest to rid himself of restrictive morality was an attempt to regain something he was sure had been
stifled in him, something that he had lost as he had left childhood. What Fats wanted to recover was a
kind of innocence, and the route he had chosen back to it was through all the things that were supposed
to be bad for you, but which, paradoxically, seemed to Fats to be the one true way to authenticity; to a
kind of purity. It was curious how often everything was back to front, the inverse of what they told
you; Fats was starting to think that if you flipped every bit of received wisdom on its head you would
have the truth. He wanted to journey through dark labyrinths and wrestle with the strangeness that
lurked within; he wanted to crack open piety and expose hypocrisy; he wanted to break taboos and
squeeze wisdom from their bloody hearts; he wanted to achieve a state of amoral grace, and be
baptized backwards into ignorance and simplicity.
And so he decided to break one of the few school rules he had not yet contravened, and walked away,
into the Fields.

COMPOSITION
Adolescents usually either disapprove of, or are remarkably indifferent to, family values and
opinionated judgements. Do you think that today’s generation clash is more extreme than it used to be
in the past? What do the young people of today really care about? Is their way of protesting different
from that of the older generation?
Discuss the topic in a composition of about 300 words.

The fairest of them all: why Europe beats the US on equality
The inequality gap is widening across the globe – but Europe restricts the damage better than
everywhere else.

Inequality is on the rise across the world, but it’s not increasing everywhere at the same pace. In many
ways Europe stands out as a positive exception. Despite all the criticism thrown at the EU, it is a
global leader in preserving a degree of fairness in the social fabric. This may seem unlikely – Europe is
hardly devoid of problems and tensions. Parts of the left depict it as a vehicle for neoliberal economic
policies, and parts of the right deride it as an inefficient administrative monster. So how is Europe
really doing?
It’s hard to exaggerate the difference between western Europe and the USA when it comes to
inequality. In 1980, these blocs of similar population and average income were also similar in income
inequality: the top 1% captured around 10% of national income, while the poorest 50% took around
20%.
Things have changed dramatically since then. Today, the top 1% in Europe take 12% of income (in the
US, 20%) while the bottom 50% have 22% (in the US, 10%).

It’s often said that globalisation and digitalisation explain the surge in global inequality, but that’s not
a very convincing narrative. Since the 1980s, Europe and the US have had similar exposure to global
markets and new technologies. But they have differed in policies and institutional direction. To date,
Europe has shown that it’s much better at keeping inequality in check.
Put bluntly, the EU has resisted the notion of turning its market economy into a market society. It has
partly rejected the thinking of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, in which market forces, in the
absence of any regulation, provide the best of all worlds in areas such as education, health and wages.
[…] That said, social healthcare systems in most European countries still guarantee universal
protection for all – hardly the case in the US. Many of those countries offer free access to university.
Indeed, when policymakers in Bavaria attempted to introduce university fees in 2007, a referendum
later overturned the decision. A young European’s hopes of receiving higher education depends much
less on his or her parents’ income than their American counterpart’s.
Labour markets are also more favourable to workers in Europe than in the US, where the minimum
wage has fallen by a third in real terms since the 1970s (in France it has risen fourfold). In Sweden and
Germany, trade unions are represented in corporate governance bodies, taking part in strategic
decision-making. European regulation against lethal, polluting substances is stricter than elsewhere,
and European countries are at the forefront of the global fight against climate change, investing a
growing share of their GDP in energy efficiency and renewables. That’s also the key to reducing
inequality, now and in the future. Studies show that environmental degradation and inequality are
closely linked.
Generous welfare states need to be financed, of course. Europe is a patchwork of taxation systems. But
overall the continent has been good at protecting progressive taxation – which has not been the case in
the US, Britain and also countries such as India, where inequality has mushroomed. Progressive
taxation is a proven tool against entrenched privileges at the very top; it also helps finance investment
and public expenditure designed to lift income levels at the bottom.

The EU has been instrumental in helping its poorer member states, and its low-income regions, catch
up with those that are better off. The picture is not perfect, but EU cohesion funds have done a lot to
fill some of the gaps and help its newer members.
But this brings us to the less positive side. Since 2007, Europe has been rocked by economic and
institutional crises. Germany’s powerful export-oriented economy – which contained wages and
consumption – has benefited from the single currency at the expense of its neighbours, who have been
tied down by strict monetary policies. Despite attempts by EU policymakers to solve this problem (and
repeated claims that they have), public debt levels in Greece remain unsustainable. Austerity measures
in southern Europe have cut into much-needed welfare programmes and led to a rise in poverty,
fuelling legitimate resentment against the EU. Europe stands at a crossroads. If it wants to avoid
alienating younger generations, and the risk of implosion, it must find solutions other than austerity.
[…]
Europe has done relatively well in the fight against inequality since 1980, and now it feels buoyed by
signs of economic improvement. But European leaders would be naive to assume the status quo can be
sustained. To preserve its social model, the EU needs to establish common progressive fiscal rules and
relieve younger generations of debts they are not responsible for.
The EU must democratise its economic governance, integrate more – including politically – and
establish common fiscal rules. That may seem like a tall order, but it isn’t when it’s set against some of
the leaps Europe has taken in the past – which have helped make it, for all its flaws, the fairest region
in the world.
