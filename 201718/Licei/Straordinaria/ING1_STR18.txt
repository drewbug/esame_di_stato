Technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to be pervasive, with impacts and ramifications
in health, economics, security and governance. In combination with other emerging and converging
technologies, AI has the potential to transform our society through better decision-making and improvements
to the human condition.
But, without adequate risk assessment and mitigation, AI may pose a threat to existing vulnerabilities in our
defences, economic systems, and social structures, argue the authors of the Wilson Center report, Artificial
Intelligence: A Policy-Oriented Introduction, Anne Bowser, Michael Sloan, Pietro Michelucci and Eleonore
Pauwels.
Recognizing the increasing integration of technology in society, this policy brief grounds the present
excitement around AI in an objective analysis of capability trends before summarizing perceived benefits and
risks. It also introduces an emerging sub-field of AI known as Human Computation, which can help achieve
future AI capabilities by strategically inserting humans in the loop where pure AI still falls short.
Policy recommendations suggest how to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks for science and society,
particularly by incorporating human participation into complex socio-technical systems to ensure the safe and
equitable development of automated intelligence.
The report offers a number of key recommendations:
Planning in an Age of Complexity: recommendations for policymakers and funders
AI is a critical component of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), “a fusion of technologies that is blurring
the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.”
Compared to previous revolutions involving processes like mechanization, mass production, and automation,
the fourth industrial revolution is characterized by the convergence of new and emerging technologies in
complex socio-technical systems that permeate every aspect of human life.
Convergence also implies the increasing interaction of multiple fields, such as AI, genomics and
nanotechnology, which rapidly expands the range of possible impacts that need to be considered in any science
policy exercise.
Ten years ago, nanotechnology was celebrated largely for its impacts on chemistry and material sciences. But
the ability to precision engineer matter at genetically relevant scale has resulted in significant advances in
genomics and neurosciences, such as creating the ability to model networks of neurons. This example
illustrates how the convergence of two emerging technologies - AI and genomics- leads to advances beyond
the initial capabilities of either alone. Meeting the challenges of convergence requires drawing on a wide range
of expertise, and taking a systems approach to promoting responsible research and innovation.
As “outsiders” to the AI design processes, it is extremely difficult for policymakers to estimate AI development
due to limited comprehension of how the technology functions. Many may also draw inspiration from
traditional regulatory models that are inadequate for AI, playing a catch-up game to decode the terms of
reference used by researchers, or fall victim to the human fallacy of overestimating the short-term capabilities
of new technologies.

Conduct broad and deep investigations into AI with leading researchers from the private sector and
universities.
In the US, early reports from policy bodies and researchers at institutions such as Stanford offer high-level
roadmaps of AI R&D. Expert groups convening under organizations like IEEE compliment these overviews
with in-depth considerations of things like ethically-aligned AI design to maximize human well-being.
In the near-future, AI researchers involved in collaboration with policymakers should conduct additional indepth studies to better understand and anticipate aspects of AI related to (for example) job automation at a
more granular level, considering impact across time, sectors, wage levels, education degrees, job types and
regions. For instance, rather than low-skill jobs that require advanced hand-dexterity, AI systems might more
likely replace routine but high-level cognitive skills. Additional studies could investigate areas like national
security.
Advocate for a systems approach to AI research and development that accounts for other emerging
technologies and promotes human participation.
AI seeks to replicate human intelligence in machines – but humanlike intelligence already exists in humans.
Today there is an opportunity to develop superhuman intelligence by pairing the complementary abilities of
human cognition with the best available AI methods to create hybrid distributed intelligent systems. In other
words, it is in our reach to build networks of humans and machines that sense, think, and act collectively with
greater efficacy than either humans or AI systems alone.
The emerging subfield of AI known as Human Computation is exploring exactly those opportunities by
inserting humans into the loop in various information processing systems to perform the tasks that exceed the
abilities of machine AI. For this reason, human computation is jokingly referred to as “Artificial AI”. […]

The Second World War was such a shattering, overwhelming experience for Britain that it is tempting to
isolate the country we became afterwards from the pre-war Britain, as if a huge blade fell across the national
story. In obvious ways this is true. The war changed Britain physically and industrially, destroying city centres;
it ultimately changed who lived here by encouraging both immigration and emigration. It changed Britain’s
political climate and our attitude to government. It even changed, through a subsequent jump in the birth rate,
relations between the generations. Yet in other ways post-war Britain was simply a continuation of the Britain
of the thirties. When it was all over, and before Churchill was voted out of power, the Parliament of 1945 was
the same one elected in 1935, a Commons frozen from another time. Deference and respect for the Royal
Family, belief in the superiority of the white man, a complacent assumption that British manufacturing was
still best … all that survived seemingly unaltered through the years of danger.
Britain still believed herself to be in her imperial heyday, mistress of the seas. Though we think of it as
essentially Victorian, the British Empire, declaring itself the first “world state” had continued to grow right up
until the mid-thirties. At the beginning of the Second World War there were some 200 colonies, dominions
and possessions connected to London, covering more than 11 million square miles. The Empire embraced
Pacific tribesmen and Eskimos, ancient African kingdoms and the rubble of the great Mughal empire,
Australian farmers and the gold-miners of South Africa. It ran from the Scottish Highlands to the Antarctic,
from the French-speaking villages of Quebec to the mosques of the Middle East. For a comparatively small
nation of fewer than 50 million people to have acquired all this might seem a global absurdity, a large joke in
the history of humankind.
Relatively few of those square miles helped the British economy thrive yet the Empire was considered the
essence of British power, a global financial and trading system independent of the rising might of the United
States. “The Empire on which the sun never sets” was not poetic, but factual. Imperial feeling still suffused
the Britain of the forties and fifties. Schools displayed the famous red-splattered maps and taught the history
of Clive’s battles in India and the achievements of missionaries in Africa. Children encyclopedias brimmed
with information about the calico industries of the subcontinent, or those useful rubber trees in Malaya.
Middle-class bookshelves groaned with Kipling, Somerset Maugham, Henry and T. E. Lawrence. The Empire
was everywhere, inside the home and out, in street names and statues, the Indian knick-knacks and elephantfoot umbrella stands, Bombay gin and Imperial Leather soap, the rhododendron bushes from the Himalayas,
words like tiffin and bungalows and the eating of the kedgeree for breakfast by all those retired Indian civil
servants and administrators in the Home Counties. There were the names of the major companies – Imperial
Chemical Industries, Home and Colonial Stores, British Imperial Airways, the Imperial Rubber Company.
Empire Day was celebrated until 1958. More seriously there was continuing large-scale emigration from the
British Isles to Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Until the sixties, one in five emigrants were
heading from the UK to the old “Crown Commonwealth” countries and more than a million Britons went to
Australia alone during 1946-1972. On wet days, back home, there were the endless Pathé and Movietone
newsreels of Royal visits to New Zealand or some dependent territory. Twenty years earlier the Royal Navy,
like the British Empire, had seemed at its zenith, a world-dominating power. […]
The Navy was for the British what the roads and legions had been for the Romans, the thin, steely web holding
together many different lands and people. By the twentieth century, with a quarter of the world under British
rule, no country had ever claimed power over so many people and so much land. It had been made possible
by a centuries-old British love affair with salt water, and by the Victorian enthusiasms for steam power and

the appliance of science. In the twentieth century these traits, which had made Britain Great, were in decline.
Even so, the Navy continued to enthral the British in the first half of that century in ways we now struggle to
remember; sea shanties on music-hall stages, the books of Marryat and Forrester for boys, the great Spithead
reviews, the Dreadnoughts on cigarette cards, the blue-and-gold uniforms at Court. Drake and Raleigh, Cook
and Nelson, were the subjects of ten thousand history lessons in almost every school in the country. To be
British was to thrill at the sight of a White Ensign.

He sighed, and at the same moment a woman stopped to ask him if he could receive her dry cleaning as she
was going out. She had a rude, impatient manner and rather than look at him as she spoke she stared at a
calendar on his desk, a grey block with a digital screen, which informed whoever was standing in front of it
exactly what moment they were in to the second. It was the twenty-fifth of the month of October, in the year
two thousand and eight, and the time was twelve-thirty-six and twenty-three seconds. I turned to leave; the
doorman dealt with the woman and hurried out from behind his desk to open the front door for me. He asked
me where I was going: I said I didn’t know. I walked out into the city. It was a perfect autumnal London
afternoon, chill but bright, under certain trees there was a shedding of golden leaves. I walked past the cricket
ground and the mosque, past Madame Tussauds, up Goodge Street and down Tottenham Court Road, through
Trafalgar Square, and found myself finally in Embankment, and then crossing the bridge. I thought – as I often
think as I cross that bridge – of two young men, students, who were walking over it very late one night when
they were mugged and thrown over the railing, into the Thames. One lived and one died. I’ve never understood
how the survivor managed it, in the darkness, in the absolute cold, with the terrible shock and his shoes on.
Thinking of him, I kept to the right-hand side of the bridge, by the railway line, and avoided looking at the
water. When I reached the South Bank the first thing I saw was a poster advertising an afternoon event with
an Austrian film director “in conversation”, it was starting in twenty minutes at the Royal Festival Hall. I
decided on a whim to try to get a ticket. I walked over and was able to buy a seat in the gods, in the very back
row. I didn’t expect much, I only wanted to be distracted from my own problems for a while, to sit in darkness,
and hear a discussion of films I’d never seen, but in the middle of the programme the director asked his
interviewer to roll a clip from the movie Swing Time, a film I know very well, I only watched it over and over
as a child. I sat up tall in my seat. On the huge screen before me Fred Astaire danced with three silhouetted
figures. They can’t keep up with him, they begin to lose their rhythm. Finally they throw in the towel, making
that very American “oh phooey” gesture with their three left hands, and walking off stage. Astaire danced on
alone. I understood all three of the shadows were also Fred Astaire. Had I known that, as a child? No one else
paws the air like that, no other dancer bends his knees in quite that way. Meanwhile the director spoke of a
theory of his, about “pure cinema”, which he began to define as the “interplay of light and dark, expressed as
a kind of rhythm, over time”, but I found this line of thought boring and hard to follow. Behind him the same
clip, for some reason, played again, and my feet, in sympathy with the music, tapped at the seat in front of me.
I felt a wonderful lightness in my body, a ridiculous happiness, it seemed to come from nowhere. I’d lost my
job, a certain version of my life, my privacy, yet all these things felt small and petty next to this joyful sense I
had watching the dance, and following its precise rhythms in my own body. I felt I was losing track of my
physical location, rising above my body, viewing my life from a very distant point, hovering over it. It
reminded me of the way people describe hallucinogenic drug experiences. I saw all my years at once, but they
were not piled up on each other, experience after experience, building into something of substance – the
opposite. A truth was being revealed to me: that I had always tried to attach myself to the light of other people,
that I had never had any light of my own. I experienced myself as a kind of shadow.

Modigliani packs a powerful, emotional punch - Tate Modern, review
Few artists have suffered such a dramatic reverse in their critical fortunes as Amedeo Modigliani. The Parisbased Italian painter’s status as art’s ultimate starving-in-a-garret, beautiful loser can hardly be contested –
dying in penury of drug and alcohol-aggravated tuberculosis aged just 35, his lover killing herself and their
unborn child just days later. Yet Modigliani’s stylised, instantly recognisable portraits and nudes with their
long necks and lustrous dark eyes, once regarded as among the most powerful and emotive images of the 20th
century, now barely figure in serious tellings of the story of modern art.
This is because the revival of interest in classic modernism over the past couple of decades – white cube
architecture as well as severe abstraction – has seen the more romantic side of modern art, typified by
Modigliani, and that other once-great, but now derided figure Marc Chagall, written off as mannered and
essentially soft-centred.
The people at Tate seem out to remedy this situation, and are clearly anticipating a major success with this,
the largest Modigliani exhibition ever mounted in the UK. The usually dry wall texts have a novelettish
breathlessness (“Paris offered excitement. Paris offered variety”), while virtual reality headsets allow you to
sit in Modigliani’s draughty studio, with rain drumming on the roof and the artist’s cigarette burning scarily
low on the bench beside his palette. More significantly, the 100 works on show include many of his most
famous paintings.
Born into a Jewish family in Livorno in 1884, Modigliani arrived in Paris in 1906, at a moment when the likes
of Picasso and Braque were shattering traditional notions of form and space under the influence of Cezanne
and African art. Modigliani, a close friend of Picasso – and of just about everyone else who mattered in Paris
at the time – fused the same elements into an approach that looks superficially similar to Picasso’s cubism,
but couldn’t in fact be more different.
Some of the early paintings, such as The Beggar of Livorno, 1909, with its wash-like greens and blues, could
pass for Cezannes. But in The Young Gypsy, from the same year, the quintessential Modigliani style appears
already almost fully formed: evident in the sloping shoulders, elongated to create a column-like central form,
the wide cheekbones and slanting eyes, exaggerated to enhance a sense of feral sensuality.
Modigliani, like Picasso, reduced the human face and body to essential form, but where Picasso’s cubist
portraits obliterate the identity of the sitter, Modigliani is out to heighten it. In a trio of striking portraits of his
dealer Paul Guillaume, the head is refined into a kind of piggy-eyed rhomboid box, with a tiny bee-stung
mouth. While you might take these images as cubistic caricature, the subject is surprisingly recognisable from
a photograph shown alongside.
Modigliani’s interest in creating a new kind of monumental form – far from trying to destroy it – is apparent
in his brief foray into sculpture; though the roomful of Egyptian and African-influenced female stone heads
seen here feel very much of their time; like something you’d expect to see on the side of an art deco cinema.
When this exotic stylisation is transposed into painted portraits, such as Madam Pompadour (1915), the effect
is mask-like and rather sub-Matisse. It’s when Modigliani brings both feel and appearance vividly before us,
that he comes into his own. This is evident in a wonderful room of portraits of notable figures from early
modernist Paris: the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz in his polo-neck jumper, the artist and actor Gaston Modot with
his flat diamond-shaped eyes. Best of all is the poet Max Jacob, whose predatory features are refined into a
red-tinged, blade-like form.

These are paintings that break the cardinal rules of modernism by focusing on human content and feeling
rather than pure form, and they pack a powerful emotional punch.
The dark-bobbed Portrait of a Girl, for example, should be easily written off as a rather mundane likeness that
can’t make up its mind whether it wants to be traditional or modern. But like many of the works here, she gets
under your skin on a kind of “guilty pleasure” level.

Edward W. Said scrisse che “tutta la conoscenza che riguarda la società umana, e non il mondo naturale, è
conoscenza storica, e di conseguenza fondata sul giudizio e l’interpretazione soggettiva. Questo non significa
che i fatti o i dati, non sono rilevanti, ma che questi fatti acquisiscono la loro importanza a seconda di come
vengono interpretati ... poiché la stessa interpretazione dipende da chi ne è l’interprete, a chi questi si rivolge
e a che scopo e dal momento storico in cui questa interpretazione avviene.”
Esprimi le tue considerazioni in merito all’opinione espressa da Said, per quanto riguarda la “soggettività” del
racconto storico, politico e culturale dei popoli

Rita Levi-Montalcini sosteneva che “C'è solo una categoria che possa stabilire i limiti alla scienza: gli
scienziati. Che non sono affatto delle persone irresponsabili.”
Affronta l’argomento della responsabilità dello scienziato coinvolto nella ricerca scientifica e la capacità di
prevedere le successive applicazioni scientifiche nei vari campi. Valuta criticamente la questione ed esprimi
le tue opinioni sulla “responsabilità” degli scienziati e sulla possibilità di imporre limiti alla scienza.

[…] At the interview Mr Druce said to Dougal, “We feel the time has come to take on an Arts man. Industry
and the Arts must walk hand in hand.”
Mr Druce had formerly been blond, he was of large build. Dougal, who in the University Dramatics had taken
the part of Rizzio in a play about Mary, Queen of Scots, leaned forward and put all his energy into his own
appearance; he dwelt with a dark glow on Mr Druce, he raised his right shoulder, which was already highly
crooked by nature, and leaned on his elbow with a becoming twist of the body. Dougal put Mr Druce through
the process of his smile, which was wide and full of white young teeth; he made movements with the alarming
bones of his hands. Mr Druce could not keep his eyes off Dougal, as Dougal perceived.
“I feel I’m your man,” Dougal said. “Something told me so when I woke first thing this morning.”
“Is that so?” Mr Druce said. “Is that so?”
“Only a hunch,” said Dougal. “I may be wrong.”
“Now look,” said Mr Druce, “I must tell you that we feel we have to see other candidates and can’t come to
any decision straight away.”
“Quite,” said Dougal.
At the second interview Mr Druce paved the floor, while Dougal sat like a monkey-puzzle tree, only moving
his eyes to follow Mr Druce. “You’ll find the world of Industry a tough one,” Mr Druce said.
Dougal changed his shape and became a professor. He leaned one elbow over the back of his chair and reflected
kindly upon Mr Druce.
“We are creating this post,” said Mr Druce. “We already have a Personnel Manager, Mr Weedin. He needs an
assistant. We feel we need a man with vision. We feel you should come under Weedin. But you should largely
work on your own and find your own level, we feel. Of course you will be under Mr Weedin.”
Dougal leaned forward and became a television interviewer. Mr Druce stopped walking and looked at him in
wonder.
“Tell me,” coaxed Dougal, “can you give me some rough idea of my duties?”
“It’s up to you, entirely up to you. We feel there’s a place for an Arts man to bring vision into the lives of the
workers. Wonderful people. But they need vision, we feel. Motion study did marvels in the factory. We had a
man from Cambridge advising on motion study. It speeded up our output thirty per cent. Movements required
to do any given task were studied in detail and he worked out the simplest pattern of movement involving the
least loss of energy and time.”
“The least loss of energy and time!” Dougal commented.
“The least loss of energy and time,” said Mr Druce. ‘All our workers’ movements are now designed to conserve
energy and time in feeding the line. You’ll see it on the posters all over the factory, “Conserve energy and
time in feeding the line.”
“In feeding the line!” Dougal said.
“In feeding the line,” Mr Druce said. “As I say, this expert came from Cambridge. But we felt that a Cambridge
man in Personnel wouldn’t do. What we feel about you is you’ll be in touch with the workers, or rather, as we
prefer to say, our staff; you’ll be in the know, we feel. Of course, you’ll find the world of Industry a tough
one.”

Dougal turned sideways in his chair and gazed out of the window at the railway bridge; he was now a man of
vision with a deformed shoulder. “The world of Industry,” said Dougal, “throbs with human life. It will be my
job to take the pulse of the people and plumb the industrial depths of Peckham.”

Mr Druce said: “Exactly. You have to bridge the gap and hold out a helping hand. Our absenteeism,” he said,
“is a problem.”
“They must be bored with their jobs,” said Dougal in a split second of absent-mindedness.
“I wouldn’t say bored,” said Mr Druce. “Not bored. Meadows Meade are building up a sound reputation with
regard to their worker-staff. We have a training scheme, a recreation scheme, and a bonus scheme. We haven’t
yet got a pension scheme, or a marriage scheme, or a burial scheme, but these will come. Comparatively
speaking we are a small concern, I admit, but we are expanding.”
“I shall have to do research,” Dougal mused, “into their inner lives. Research into the real Peckham. It will be
necessary to discover their spiritual well-spring, the glorious history of the place, before I am able to offer
some impetus.”
Mr Druce betrayed a little emotion. “But no lectures on Art,” he said, pulling himself together. “We’ve tried
them. They didn’t quite come off. The workers, the staff, don’t like coming back to the building after working
hours. Too many outside attractions. Our aim is to be one happy family.” […]

I blame the T-shirts. The casual wear favoured by those founding wunderkinds of tech – Mark Zuckerberg,
Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and the rest – lulled us into a false sense of security. Even after they’d
begun making serious money, too many of us took the aversion to a collar and tie to mean the likes of Facebook
or Google were not really scary capitalist behemoths, but retained the spirit of the upstart startup: quirky,
plucky and driven chiefly by a desire to do cool stuff with computers. They certainly saw themselves that way,
Google charmingly distilling its mission statement into three words: “Don’t be evil.” It’s amazing how long
an initial image of laidback informality can endure: for decades, Britons struggled to see Virgin as a corporate
giant because Richard Branson had long hair and a goatee.
In truth, it wasn’t just the look. The apparent idealism of the enterprise also encouraged consumers to give the
tech Goliaths the benefit of the doubt. In its infancy, the internet was hailed as a harbinger of equality and
liberty. The new gospel held that “information wants to be free” – free from censorship and free of charge. A
new techno-utopia seemed at hand. Or as Zuckerberg defined his company’s purpose: “Facebook gives people
the power to share and make the world more open and connected.”
Those words leave a bitter taste now, after Carole Cadwalladr’s ground-shaking revelation that Cambridge
Analytica had helped itself to the Facebook data of 50 million users. But it was not so long ago that the internet,
and specifically social media, were seen as forces that might transform the world for good, harming the
powerful and strengthening the weak.
A crucial example is provided in War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the 21st
Century, an insightful, richly reported book by David Patrikarakos. A correspondent who has covered several
recent conflicts, he was struck by the emergence of what he calls Homo digitalis, the lone individual who,
armed with nothing more than a smartphone, is able to shape global perceptions of the battle fought around
them. He shows how a 16-year-old Gazan, Farah Baker, used a Twitter account to give real-time reports on
the daily bombardments that came in the summer of 2014, steadily building up a vast international audience
and leaving the mighty Israel Defence Forces playing catch-up. In the age of social media, he writes, even the
most powerful “states can win the physical battle on the ground but lose the political war”.
There are countless examples, from the Egyptian teenagers who used Facebook to rally protesters to Tahrir
Square, eventually toppling the Mubarak regime, to the British blogger who methodically proved Russia had
supplied the weapon that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, leaving Moscow’s
denials in tatters. The asymmetry in each case was vast – and yet the weaker party won.
Thanks to social media, the internet had apparently decentralised power. In the old days, information was
passed down from the mountain top – by a government, say, or a news organisation – to the crowd below.
Now the crowd could speak to each other and to the world. At least one aspect of the techno-utopians’ early
hopes seemed to have materialised.
And it’s that hope that Cambridge Analytica has shattered. For what we now understand is that those at the
top, the political parties or governments that could afford it, have been engaged in a radical act of recentralising
power. They saw the way social media was working, empowering individuals and networks of individuals,
and they decided to grab those same weapons for themselves.
You can see why they were tempted, for our digital footprint is extraordinarily revealing. Witness the model
built by researchers at Stanford and Cambridge that, simply by looking at your Facebook “likes”, can assess
your personality with a startling degree of accuracy. It takes just 10 “likes” for the computer to know you

so many others were ready to hand over big money to Cambridge Analytica. This week I met Hossein
Derakhshan, a true Homo digitalis once known as Iran’s “blogfather”, whose activities earned him six years
in prison. “Predictability is control,” he told me, recalling the hold his jailers had over him. Once you can
predict someone’s actions and reactions, you can control them. […]
This week’s revelations are not exactly a loss of innocence: many shed their turn-of-the-century illusions about
the internet years ago. And there will be more disenchantment to come. It can’t be only political campaigners
who used the likes of Cambridge Analytica to pickpocket our personal data; surely we’ll learn soon of the
major corporations that similarly played on our online hopes and fears to sell us stuff. But we don’t have to
have the full picture to know that we have to act. It could be regulation; it could be anti-trust legislation to
break up those tech giants that act as virtual monopolies […]
