Who is behind the wheel? Self-driving cars offer huge benefits—but have a dark side
Policymakers must apply the lessons of the horseless carriage to the driverless car

5

A new kind of vehicle is taking to the roads, and people are not sure what to make of it. Is it safe? How
will it get along with other road users? Will it really shake up the way we travel? These questions are
being asked today about autonomous vehicles (AVs). Exactly the same questions were posed when the
first motor cars rumbled onto the roads. By granting drivers unprecedented freedom, automobiles changed
the world. They also led to unforeseen harm, from strip malls and urban sprawl to road rage and climate
change. Now AVs are poised to rewrite the rules of transport—and there is a danger that the same mistake
will be made all over again. […]
Clean, dream machines

Assuming the technology can be made to work as AV firms expect, it is not hard to imagine the
beginnings of the driverless era. Cost means that self-driving vehicles will at first serve as robotaxis,
summoned using a ride-hailing app. That way they get used more, offsetting their costs, and provide
transport that is cheaper per mile than owning a car, undermining the case for car ownership, at least for
townies. […]
AVs would dramatically reduce the number of road deaths and, being electric, cut harmful emissions in
places with clean grids. Clever routing, closer spacing between vehicles and dynamic congestioncharging could cut traffic. Like cars before them, AVs will reshape cities (a long commute is easier if you
work or sleep en route) and redefine retailing (shops can come to you). Carmakers will face enormous
change; instead of selling to individuals, they will supply fleet operators, or reinvent themselves as
“mobility service” providers.
Economists and urban planners should rejoice because AVs mean that, for the first time, the unwelcome
externalities associated with cars can be fully priced in. In particular, dynamic road-tolling and congestion
charging, adjusting the cost per kilometre according to the time of day, level of traffic, length of trip and
so on, will allow fine-tuning of entire urban-transport systems. By setting taxes and tolls accordingly,
planners can subsidise rides in poor districts, for example, or encourage people to use public transport for
longer trips. They can also ensure that the roads do not end up full of empty vehicles looking for riders.
Such granular road-pricing is the logical conclusion of existing schemes. Some cities already have
congestion-charging regimes, subsidise ride-hailing in poor areas ill-served by public transport, or impose
per-ride taxes on Uber, Lyft and their kind.
Yet the same tolling schemes that will let city planners minimise congestion or subsidise robotaxi services
in underserved “transport deserts” have a darker side—and one to which too little attention has been paid.
AVs will offer an extraordinarily subtle policy tool which can, in theory, be used to transform cities; but
in the hands of authoritarian governments could also become a powerful means of social control.

For a start, AVs will record everything that happens in and around them. When a crime is committed, the
police will ask nearby cars if they saw anything. Fleet operators will know a great deal about their riders.
In one infamous analysis of passenger data, Uber identified one-night stands. If, as seems likely, humandriven cars are gradually banned on safety grounds, passengers could lose the freedom to go anywhere
they choose. The risk that not all robotaxis will serve all destinations could open the door to segregation
and discrimination. In authoritarian countries, robotaxis could restrict people’s movements. If all this
sounds implausible, recall that Robert Moses notoriously designed the Southern State Parkway, linking
New York City to Long Island’s beaches, with low bridges to favour access by rich whites in cars, while
discriminating against poor blacks in buses. And China’s “social credit” system, which awards points
based on people’s behaviour, already restricts train travel for those who step out of line. […]
Autonomous vehicles offer passengers freedom from accidents, pollution, congestion and the bother of
trying to find a parking space. But they will require other freedoms to be given up in return—especially
the ability to drive your own vehicle anywhere. Choices about who can go where, when and how are
inescapably political in nature.
A century ago cars were seized upon as a solution to the drawbacks of horses, which were clogging city
streets with manure. The broader social consequences of cars, both good and bad, were entirely
unforeseen. Today the danger is that AVs will be treated merely as a technological solution to the
problems associated with cars and that, once again, the wider impacts will be overlooked.

PRODUCTION
Choose one of the following questions.
Number your answer clearly to show which question you have chosen.
Either
1. “Removing the horse from horse-drawn carriages was an apparently simple change that had farreaching effects. Similarly, there is much more to autonomous vehicles than simply removing the need
for a driver—and much of their impact is a consequence of the fact that they will mostly be shared, not
owned.” (The Economist)

U.S. Immigration Before 1965
The U.S. has always been a nation of immigrants. […] By the 1500s, the first Europeans, led by the
Spanish and French, had begun establishing settlements in what would become the United States. In
1607, the English founded their first permanent settlement in present-day America at Jamestown in the
Virginia Colony. […]
5

Some of North America’s first settlers came in search of freedom to practice their faith. In 1620, a group
of roughly 100 people, later known as the Pilgrims, fled religious persecution in Europe and arrived at
present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts, where they established a colony. By some estimates, 20,000
Puritans migrated to the region between 1630 and 1640.

15

Most immigrants came voluntarily to America seeking economic opportunities. […] But not all.
Thousands of English convicts were shipped across the Atlantic as indentured servants. Others who
arrived against their will during the colonial period were black slaves from West Africa. By 1680, there
were some 7,000 African slaves in the American colonies, a number that ballooned to 700,000 by 1790,
according to some estimates. Congress outlawed the importation of slaves to the United States as of 1808,
but the practice continued. The U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) resulted in the emancipation of
approximately 4 million slaves.

20

Another major wave of immigration occurred from around 1815 to 1865. The majority were from
Northern and Western Europe. Approximately one-third came from Ireland, which experienced a massive
famine in the mid-19th century. In the 1840s, almost half of U.S. immigrants were from Ireland alone.
Typically impoverished, these Irish immigrants settled near their point of arrival in cities along the East
Coast. Between 1820 and 1930, some 4.5 million Irish migrated to the United States.

10

25

30

35

Also, in the 19th century, the United States received some 5 million German immigrants. […] In the
national census of 2000, more US citizens claimed German ancestry than any other group. During the
mid-1800s, a significant number of Asian immigrants settled in the United States. Lured by news of the
California gold rush, some 25,000 Chinese had migrated there by the early 1850s. The influx of
newcomers resulted in anti-immigrant sentiment among certain factions of the U.S.’s native-born,
predominantly Anglo-Saxon Protestant population. The new arrivals were often seen as unwanted
competition for jobs, while many Catholics–especially the Irish–experienced discrimination for their
religious beliefs.
One of the first significant pieces of federal legislation aimed at restricting immigration was the Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from coming to America. Californians had
agitated for the new law, blaming the Chinese, who were willing to work for less, for a decline in wages.
For much of the 1900s, the federal government had left immigration policy to individual states. However,
in 1890, President Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901) designated Ellis Island, located in New York Harbour
near the Statue of Liberty, as a federal immigration station. More than 12 million immigrants entered the
United States through Ellis Island during its years of operation from 1892 to 1954.

Between 1880 and 1920, a time of rapid industrialization and urbanization, the US received more than 20
million immigrants. In the 1890s, the majority of arrivals were from Central, Eastern and Southern
Europe. In that decade alone, some 600,000 Italians migrated to America, and by 1920 more than 4
million had entered the United States. Jews from Eastern Europe fleeing religious persecution also arrived
in large numbers; over 2 million entered the United States between 1880 and 1920. The peak year for
admission of new immigrants was 1907, when approximately 1.3 million people entered the country
legally.

50

Within a decade, the outbreak of WWI (1914-1918) caused a decline in immigration. In 1917, Congress
enacted legislation requiring immigrants over 16 to pass a literacy test, and in the early 1920s
immigration quotas were established. The Immigration Act of 1924 created a quota system that restricted
entry to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in America as of the 1890 national
census – a system that favoured immigrants from Western Europe – and prohibited immigrants from
Asia.

55

Immigration plummeted during the global depression of the 1930s and WWII (1939-1945). Between
1930 and 1950, the U.S.’s foreign-born population decreased from 14.2 to 10.3 million, or from 11.6 to
6.9 percent of the total population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. After the war, Congress passed
special legislation enabling war and political refugees from Europe and the Soviet Union to enter the
United States. […]

45

In 1965, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, which did away with quotas based on
nationality and allowed U.S. citizens to sponsor relatives from their countries of origin. As a result of this
act, and of subsequent legislation, the nation experienced a shift in immigration patterns. Today, the
majority of U.S. immigrants come from Asia and Latin America rather than from Europe.

Choose one of the following questions.
Number your answer clearly to show which question you have answered.
Either
1. Throughout human history people have always migrated, for some reason or another. Throughout
history too, the arrival of migrants has often ended up by alienating some sections of the receiving
community. Examine the reasons given in the text for why people migrated in past centuries, add any
others you can think of relating to each wave of migrants. Then examine the reactions of the U.S.
population that received these “historical” migrants. Does history repeat itself? Discuss your views in
an essay of about 300 words.
Or
2. There are two main categories of reasons why people migrate: push reasons and pull reasons. Push is
when people are forced to move in order to survive because of the political, economic, social or
religious situation in their country of origin. Pull migration is when they choose (often for economic
betterment) to move and start a new life elsewhere. Usually migrants move for a mixture of push and
pull factors. Using both the information in the text and your personal knowledge of the situation now,
suggest why people are moving today. Discuss your views in an essay of about 300 words.

My father's generation was not one accustomed to discussing and analysing in the way ours is and I
believe the telling and retelling of this story was as close as my father ever came to reflecting critically on
the profession he practised. As such, it gives a vital clue to his thinking. The story was an apparently true
one concerning a certain butler who had travelled with his employer to India and served there for many
years maintaining amongst the native staff the same high standards he had commanded in England. One
afternoon, evidently, this butler had entered the dining room to make sure all was well for dinner, when he
noticed a tiger languishing beneath the dining table. The butler had left the dining room quietly, taking
care to close the doors behind him, and proceeded calmly to the drawing room where his employer was
taking tea with a number of visitors. There he attracted his employer's attention with a polite cough, then
whispered in the latter's ear: "I'm very sorry, sir, but there appears to be a tiger in the dining room. Perhaps
you will permit the twelve-bores to be used?"
And according to legend, a few minutes later, the employer and his guests heard three gun shots. When
the butler reappeared in the drawing room some time afterwards to refresh the teapots, the employer had
inquired if all was well.

‘Perfectly fine, thank you, sir,’ had come the reply. ‘Dinner will be served at the usual time and I am
pleased to say there will be no discernible traces left of the recent occurrence by that time.’ […]
I hope you will agree that in these two instances I have cited from his career – both of which I have
had corroborated and believe to be accurate- my father not only manifests, but comes close to being the
personification itself, of what the Hayes Society terms ‘dignity in keeping with his position’. If one
considers the differences between my father at such moments and figures such as Mr Jack Neighbours
even with the best of his technical flourishes, I believe one may begin to distinguish what it is that
separate a ‘great’ butler from a merely competent one. We may now understand better, too, why my
father was so fond of the story of the butler who failed to panic on discovering a tiger under the dining
table; it was because he knew instinctively that somewhere in this story lay the kernel of what true
'dignity' is. And let me now posit this: 'dignity' has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the
professional being he inhabits. Lesser butlers will abandon their professional being for the private one at
the least provocation. For such persons, being a butler is like playing some pantomime role; a small push,
a slight stumble, and the facade will drop off to reveal the actor underneath. The great butlers are great by
virtue of their ability to inhabit their professional role and inhabit it to the utmost; they will not be shaken
out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. They wear their professionalism as a
decent gentleman will wear his suit: he will not let ruffians or circumstance tear it off him in the public
gaze; he will discard it when, and only when, he wills to do so, and this will invariably be when he is
entirely alone. It is, as I say, a matter of 'dignity'.
It is sometimes said that butlers only truly exist in England. Other countries, whatever title is actually
used, have only manservants. I tend to believe this is true. Continentals are unable to be butlers because
they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of.
Continentals - and by and large the Celts, as you will no doubt agree - are as a rule unable to control
themselves in moments of strong emotion, and are thus unable to maintain a professional demeanour
other than in the least challenging of situations. If I may return to my earlier metaphor - you will excuse

my putting it so coarsely - they are like a man who will, at the slightest provocation, tear off his suit and
his shirt and run about screaming. In a word, 'dignity' is beyond such persons. We English have an
important advantage over foreigners in this respect and it is for this reason that when you think of a great
butler, he is bound, almost by definition, to be an Englishman.

The Art World View – ABCs of Cultural Placemaking:
Authenticity, Buy-in and Connectivity

5

10

With the recent UNESCO report making the case for a focus on culture to mitigate the challenges of the
unprecedented growth of cities, cultural placemaking has moved beyond a ‘nice to have’ and into pole
position for ensuring economically viable, healthy, sustainable communities. The magic ingredient lies
not in imposed ideals of what culture should be, but rather in unpicking the complex social fabric and the
history, recorded and anecdotal, that makes a place unique. The spirit of a place matters – and can be the
most important element in creating genuine, thriving places.
Arts and culture can be a catalyst to illuminate authenticity of place, and often it can be simple and
community based initiatives that have the most impact. Our work on Sneinton Market Square, in
collaboration with Nottingham City Council and Patel Taylor Architects, brought lead artist Neville
Gabie to build a narrative identity for the Square’s regeneration. In honour of the site’s long history in
food production and distribution, Gabie’s resulting commission “Orchard” used apple trees as a lynchpin
to bring diverse elements of the local community together with a common purpose, by creating an apple
tree adoption network. A programme of events involving local artists drew people back to the Square,
celebrating its past and creating a sustainable vision for its future.

15

For developers competing in a challenging market, drawing out authentic elements of their sites can
create distinctive identity. Enlighted developers Stanhope and Mitsui have used contemporary art to
illustrate the unique history of their Angel Court site in the City of London. Artist Sara Barker’s work
Last of Light (Three Needles) which dominates the Angel Court piazza beautifully highlights motifs
drawn from the area’s history of tailoring, connecting the old with the new.

20

Gaining buy-in to the vision for the development or regeneration of a place is integral to its long-term
success. Slick marketing and public announcements won’t go far in capturing the hearts and souls of
existing communities, and local objections to proposed plans can lead to costly delays. However creative
approaches can often galvanise communities and generate embedded cultural memory in ways that
marketing cannot. Artist-led community engagement has the effect of generating emotive relationships to
place through a period of change. To support Grosvenor’s London Estate 20 year vision, our team were
appointed to develop a Culture and Animation Strategy with the aim of bringing existing cultural
establishments, local communities and visitors to the area together to celebrate the historic context of the
location whilst building a reputation for contemporary, forward looking and inclusive cultural initiatives.

Public engagement is key – the central element of our Public Art Strategy for the University of
Cambridge’s North West Cambridge Development is the programme of public events, reaching audiences
with information shared through a bespoke website which acts as a living archive of the arts programme.
“The arts strategy developed by the Contemporary Art Society […] is innovative –in seeing artists as
some of the first inhabitants of the site and using their activity to generate awareness of the development.
Opportunities to engage new and existing communities are built into all aspects of the programme –
across artists’ activity, education programmes and temporary and permanent public art commissions.”

Cultural placemaking has to take a holistic approach – where the question ‘Where is the cultural element?’
becomes an essential part of the planning and developer toolkit. Cultural animation can extend beyond
public art programming into functional and design elements – offering a visual language for wayfinding,
lighting and street furniture, creating distinctive and memorable local identity and exploring the digital
realm as a way of connecting people.
Our cultural strategy work is becoming well known for this forensic examination of place and responses
that draw inspiration from what is there to inform what may become. We work with developers,
landowners, cultural institutions and the public sector to generate these approaches, seeing the public
realm as a platform for culture in its widest sense, bringing contemporary art practice to new audiences
and building important cultural ecologies. F. Nicholas

Tema di: LINGUA INGLESE (previgente ordinamento)
I
La letteratura ed i mondi possibili: “la forza di attrazione della narrazione, la voce narrante, i tratti
distintivi dei personaggi principali, la verosimiglianza e, al contempo, la discrepanza della realtà
narrata rispetto a quella reale danno al lettore la certezza di essere sul punto di entrare in un
mondo possibile al quale crederà, fiducioso nell’esperienza estetica, emotiva e fenomenologica a
cui l’invenzione dell’autore darà forma.” (T. Pavel)
Anche facendo riferimento ad opere appartenenti alla produzione letteraria in una delle lingue
straniere studiate, commenta come la letteratura e lo spazio della scrittura estendono le capacità
creative dello scrittore e permettono al lettore l’accesso a “mondi possibili”, che diventano concreti
pur in mancanza di consistenza materiale rispetto al mondo reale.
II
Lo sviluppo della capacità imprenditoriale dei cittadini è uno degli obiettivi chiave delle politiche
europee, necessario per una società basata sulla conoscenza e sull’apprendimento permanente.
EntreComp: The Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (2016) e la più recente guida per
l’utente Entre Comp Into Action (2018) sviluppano il concetto di imprenditorialità come “una
competenza trasversale che si applica a tutte le sfere della vita: dallo sviluppo personale, alla
partecipazione attiva nella società, dall’ ingresso nel mercato del lavoro, all’avvio di nuove
iniziative di valore culturale, sociale o commerciale.”
Esprimi la tua idea di come può la scuola promuovere e sostenere lo sviluppo dello spirito di
iniziativa ed imprenditorialità tra i giovani favorendo l’autonomia delle persone e stabilendo
sinergie tra istruzione, lavoro e partecipazione civica.
III
“Il dominio della tecnica”, considerato il tratto distintivo del post-moderno, “caratterizza ancor
più marcatamente il nostro tempo, profondamente mutato dalle nuove tecnologie e dalle loro
implicazioni sociali” (A. Soro). La crescente invasività delle tecnologie digitali, dell’intelligenza
artificiale e dei Big Data rendono necessario rivendicare un ruolo attivo e consapevole rispetto ad
un predominio tecnologico sempre più totalizzante e difficile da arginare. Ciò è, soprattutto
necessario, come difesa al diritto alla privacy, alla libertà di pensiero e di parola e alla
partecipazione democratica.
Cosa si dovrebbe fare, secondo te, per tutelare la persona e il diritto agli spazi di libertà individuale
senza tuttavia rinunciare agli indiscutibili vantaggi delle nuove tecnologie?

That afternoon I addressed myself to forging a note. Now, what were the names of books written by
H. L. Mencken? I did not know any of them. I finally wrote what I thought would be a foolproof note:
Dear Madam: Will you please let this nigger boy – I used the word “nigger” to make the librarian feel
that I could not possibly be the author of the note – have some books by H. L. Mencken? I forged the
white man’s name.
I entered the library as I had always done when on errands for whites, but I felt that I would somehow
slip up and betray myself. I doffed my hat, stood a respectful distance from the desk, looked as
unbookish as possible, and waited for the white patrons to be taken care of. When the desk was clear
of people, I still waited. The white librarian looked at me.
“What do you want, boy?”
As though I did not possess the power of speech, I stepped forward and simply handed her the forged
note, not parting my lips.
“What books by Mencken does he want?” she asked. “I don’t know, ma’am,” I said, avoiding her eyes.
“Who gave you this card?”
“Mr. Falk,” I said.
“Where is he?”
“He’s at work, at the M….. Optical Company,” I said. “I’ve been in here for him before.”
“I remember,” the woman said. “But he never wrote notes like this.”
Oh, God, she’s suspicious. Perhaps she would not let me have the books? If she had turned her back at
that moment, I would have ducked out the door and never gone back. Then I thought of a bold idea.
“You can call him up, ma’am,” I said, my heart pounding.
“You’re not using these books, are you?” she asked pointedly.
“Oh, no, ma’am. I can’t read.”
“I don’t know what he wants by Mencken,” she said under her breath.
I knew now that I had won; she was thinking of other things and the race question had gone out of her
mind. She went to the shelves. Once or twice she looked over her shoulder at me, as though she was
still doubtful. Finally she came forward with two books in her hand.
“I’m sending him two books,” she said. “But tell Mr. Falk to come in next time, send me the names of
the books he wants. I don’t know what he wants to read.”
I said nothing. She stamped the card and handed me the books. Not daring to glance at them, I went
out of the library, fearing that the woman would call me back for further questioning. A block away
from the library I opened one of the books and read a title: A Book of Prefaces. I was nearing my
nineteenth birthday and I did not know how to pronounce the word “preface.” I thumbed the pages and
saw strange names. I shook my head, disappointed. I looked at the other book; it was called Prejudices.
I knew what that word meant; I had heard it all my life. And right off I was on guard against Mencken
books. Why would a man want to call a book Prejudices? The word was so stained with all my
memories of racial hate that I would not conceive of anybody using it for a title. Perhaps I had made a
mistake about Mencken? A man who had prejudices must be wrong.
When I showed the books to Mr. Falk, he looked at me and frowned.
“That librarian might telephone you,” I warned him.
“That’s all right,” he said. “But when you’re through reading those books, I want you to tell me what
you get out of them.” What does Mr Falk want the narrator to do?

That night in my rented room, while letting the hot water run over my can of pork and beans in the
sink, I opened A Book of Prefaces and began to read. I was jarred and shocked by the style, the clear,
clean, sweeping sentences. Why did he write like that? And how did one write like that? I pictured the
man as a raging demon, slashing with his pen, consumed with hate, denouncing everything American,
extolling everything European or German, laughing at the weaknesses of people, mocking God,
authority. What was this? I stood up, trying to realize what reality lay behind the meaning of the
words... Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using them
as one would use a club. Could words be weapons? Well, yes, for here they were. Then, maybe,
perhaps, I could use them as a weapon? No. It frightened me. I read on and what amazed me was not
what he said, but how on earth anybody had the courage to say it.

Iceland makes it illegal to pay men more than women
Iceland has become the first country in the world to make it illegal to pay men more than women.
Under the legislation, companies and government agencies with more than 25 employees will be
required to obtain government certification for their equal-pay policies. Those failing to demonstrate
pay equality will face fines.
5

"It's a mechanism to ensure women and men are being paid equally," Dagny Osk Aradottir Pind, a
board member of the Icelandic Women's Rights Association, told Al Jazeera. "We have had legislation
saying that pay should be equal for men and women for decades now but we still have a pay gap." The
law came into effect on Monday, the first day of the new year. It was announced on International
Women's Day on 8 March last year.

10

The legislation was supported by Iceland's centre-right coalition government, as well as the opposition,
in the country's parliament, where nearly 50 per cent of members are women. "I think that now people
are starting to realise that this is a systematic problem that we have to tackle with new methods," Ms
Aradottir Pind told Al Jazeera.

20

She added: "Women have been talking about this for decades and I really feel that we have managed to
raise awareness, and we have managed to get to the point that people realise that the legislation we
have had in place is not working, and we need to do something more."
Iceland, which has a strong economy based on tourism and fisheries, has been ranked the best in the
world for gender equality by the World Economic Forum for nine years in a row. The UK came in
15th place in 2017, with a 16.9 per cent pay gap between men and women. Iceland's government has
committed to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2022.
Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, told The Independent: “Unequal pay is already
illegal [in the UK], but what Iceland are doing is requiring employers to take a proactive approach with
government certifying what they have done.”

25

30

“From April this year the UK is introducing gender pay gap reporting, which will require employers
with over 250 employees to publish their gender pay gaps. This is a welcome step forward, but we may
need to consider more proactive measures, particularly to tackle workplace harassment and
discrimination which have been highlighted recently as a major issue in many workplaces.” She added:
“We must also remember that this isn’t just about what is in women’s interests. Holding women back
holds our economy back. Tackling gender inequality and discrimination is good for business and for
all of us.”
For Icelanders, it is a source of pride to be the frontrunner in the World Economic Forum’s Global
Gender Gap Index for the ninth year in a row. Ranking at the top is a confirmation of the successes
achieved in recent decades and inspires us to continue to work towards complete equality of status,
influence and power of men and women.

35

What is the secret to Iceland’s success? What are the lessons learned? In short, it is that gender
equality does not come about of its own accord. It requires the collective action and solidarity of
women human rights defenders, political will, and tools such as legislation, gender budgeting and
quotas.

Iceland, despite being an island, is not isolated from progress towards gender equality. As is the case
worldwide, our incremental progress can firstly be attributed to the solidarity of women human rights
defenders challenging and protesting the monopoly of power in the hands of men […] and the power
of men over women.
Secondly, the success can be attributed to women taking power and creating alternatives to the male
dominant “truths” and making the invisible realities of women visible, most importantly
discriminatory practices including sexual harassment and abuse. Lastly, Iceland’s progress can be
attributed to women and men sharing power with each other as decision-makers and gradually having
more men supporting the give and take of gender equality.
As such, the Icelandic case is nothing exceptional. It has been influenced by cultural, political,
religious, social, academic and economic currents that have washed ashore and been domestically
cultivated and created. […]

COMPOSITION:
In her novel “Wolf Hall”, Hilary Mantel, suggests “When you are writing laws you are testing words to
find their utmost power. Like spells, they have to make things happen in the real world, and like spells,
they only work if people believe in them.” People have to accept a law, if it is to be enforced. Comment
on this quote in the light of what you have just read about Iceland (top of the World Economic gender
equality list). Do you think the gender pay gap should be closed, that there should be equal pay for
equal work? Discuss your views on the topic in an essay of about 300 words.
