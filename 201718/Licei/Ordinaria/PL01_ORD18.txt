Who is behind the wheel? Self-driving cars offer huge benefits—but have a dark side
Policymakers must apply the lessons of the horseless carriage to the driverless car

5

A new kind of vehicle is taking to the roads, and people are not sure what to make of it. Is it safe? How will
it get along with other road users? Will it really shake up the way we travel? These questions are being
asked today about autonomous vehicles (AVs). Exactly the same questions were posed when the first motor
cars rumbled onto the roads. By granting drivers unprecedented freedom, automobiles changed the world.
They also led to unforeseen harm, from strip malls and urban sprawl to road rage and climate change. Now
AVs are poised to rewrite the rules of transport—and there is a danger that the same mistake will be made
all over again. […]

Assuming the technology can be made to work as AV firms expect, it is not hard to imagine the beginnings
of the driverless era. Cost means that self-driving vehicles will at first serve as robotaxis, summoned using
a ride-hailing app. That way they get used more, offsetting their costs, and provide transport that is cheaper
per mile than owning a car, undermining the case for car ownership, at least for townies. […]
AVs would dramatically reduce the number of road deaths and, being electric, cut harmful emissions in
places with clean grids. Clever routing, closer spacing between vehicles and dynamic congestion-charging
could cut traffic. Like cars before them, AVs will reshape cities (a long commute is easier if you work or
sleep en route) and redefine retailing (shops can come to you). Carmakers will face enormous change;
instead of selling to individuals, they will supply fleet operators, or reinvent themselves as “mobility
service” providers.
Economists and urban planners should rejoice because AVs mean that, for the first time, the unwelcome
externalities associated with cars can be fully priced in. In particular, dynamic road-tolling and congestion
charging, adjusting the cost per kilometre according to the time of day, level of traffic, length of trip and so
on, will allow fine-tuning of entire urban-transport systems. By setting taxes and tolls accordingly, planners
can subsidise rides in poor districts, for example, or encourage people to use public transport for longer
trips. They can also ensure that the roads do not end up full of empty vehicles looking for riders. Such
granular road-pricing is the logical conclusion of existing schemes. Some cities already have congestioncharging regimes, subsidise ride-hailing in poor areas ill-served by public transport, or impose per-ride
taxes on Uber, Lyft and their kind.
Yet the same tolling schemes that will let city planners minimise congestion or subsidise robotaxi services
in underserved “transport deserts” have a darker side—and one to which too little attention has been paid.
AVs will offer an extraordinarily subtle policy tool which can, in theory, be used to transform cities; but in
the hands of authoritarian governments could also become a powerful means of social control.

For a start, AVs will record everything that happens in and around them. When a crime is committed, the
police will ask nearby cars if they saw anything. Fleet operators will know a great deal about their riders.
In one infamous analysis of passenger data, Uber identified one-night stands. If, as seems likely, humandriven cars are gradually banned on safety grounds, passengers could lose the freedom to go anywhere they
choose. The risk that not all robotaxis will serve all destinations could open the door to segregation and
discrimination. In authoritarian countries, robotaxis could restrict people’s movements. If all this sounds
implausible, recall that Robert Moses notoriously designed the Southern State Parkway, linking New York
City to Long Island’s beaches, with low bridges to favour access by rich whites in cars, while discriminating
against poor blacks in buses. And China’s “social credit” system, which awards points based on people’s
behaviour, already restricts train travel for those who step out of line. […]
Autonomous vehicles offer passengers freedom from accidents, pollution, congestion and the bother of
trying to find a parking space. But they will require other freedoms to be given up in return—especially the
ability to drive your own vehicle anywhere. Choices about who can go where, when and how are
inescapably political in nature.
A century ago cars were seized upon as a solution to the drawbacks of horses, which were clogging city
streets with manure. The broader social consequences of cars, both good and bad, were entirely unforeseen.
Today the danger is that AVs will be treated merely as a technological solution to the problems associated
with cars and that, once again, the wider impacts will be overlooked.

U.S. Immigration Before 1965
The U.S. has always been a nation of immigrants. […] By the 1500s, the first Europeans, led by the Spanish
and French, had begun establishing settlements in what would become the United States. In 1607, the
English founded their first permanent settlement in present-day America at Jamestown in the Virginia
Colony. […]
5

10

Some of North America’s first settlers came in search of freedom to practice their faith. In 1620, a group
of roughly 100 people, later known as the Pilgrims, fled religious persecution in Europe and arrived at
present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts, where they established a colony. By some estimates, 20,000 Puritans
migrated to the region between 1630 and 1640.
Most immigrants came voluntarily to America seeking economic opportunities. […] But not all. Thousands
of English convicts were shipped across the Atlantic as indentured servants. Others who arrived against
their will during the colonial period were black slaves from West Africa. By 1680, there were some 7,000
African slaves in the American colonies, a number that ballooned to 700,000 by 1790, according to some
estimates. Congress outlawed the importation of slaves to the United States as of 1808, but the practice
continued. The U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) resulted in the emancipation of approximately 4 million slaves.

15

Another major wave of immigration occurred from around 1815 to 1865. The majority were from Northern
and Western Europe. Approximately one-third came from Ireland, which experienced a massive famine in
the mid-19th century. In the 1840s, almost half of U.S. immigrants were from Ireland alone. Typically
impoverished, these Irish immigrants settled near their point of arrival in cities along the East Coast.
Between 1820 and 1930, some 4.5 million Irish migrated to the United States.

20

Also, in the 19th century, the United States received some 5 million German immigrants. […] In the
national census of 2000, more US citizens claimed German ancestry than any other group. During the mid1800s, a significant number of Asian immigrants settled in the United States. Lured by news of the
California gold rush, some 25,000 Chinese had migrated there by the early 1850s. The influx of newcomers
resulted in anti-immigrant sentiment among certain factions of the U.S.’s native-born, predominantly
Anglo-Saxon Protestant population. The new arrivals were often seen as unwanted competition for jobs,
while many Catholics–especially the Irish–experienced discrimination for their religious beliefs.

25

One of the first significant pieces of federal legislation aimed at restricting immigration was the Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese labourers from coming to America. Californians had agitated
for the new law, blaming the Chinese, who were willing to work for less, for a decline in wages.
30

For much of the 1900s, the federal government had left immigration policy to individual states. However,
in 1890, President Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901) designated Ellis Island, located in New York Harbour
near the Statue of Liberty, as a federal immigration station. More than 12 million immigrants entered the
United States through Ellis Island during its years of operation from 1892 to 1954.

Between 1880 and 1920, a time of rapid industrialization and urbanization, the US received more than 20
million immigrants. In the 1890s, the majority of arrivals were from Central, Eastern and Southern Europe.
In that decade alone, some 600,000 Italians migrated to America, and by 1920 more than 4 million had
entered the United States. Jews from Eastern Europe fleeing religious persecution also arrived in large
numbers; over 2 million entered the United States between 1880 and 1920. The peak year for admission
of new immigrants was 1907, when approximately 1.3 million people entered the country legally.

40

Within a decade, the outbreak of WWI (1914-1918) caused a decline in immigration. In 1917, Congress
enacted legislation requiring immigrants over 16 to pass a literacy test, and in the early 1920s immigration
quotas were established. The Immigration Act of 1924 created a quota system that restricted entry to 2
percent of the total number of people of each nationality in America as of the 1890 national census – a
system that favoured immigrants from Western Europe – and prohibited immigrants from Asia.

45

Immigration plummeted during the global depression of the 1930s and WWII (1939-1945). Between 1930
and 1950, the U.S.’s foreign-born population decreased from 14.2 to 10.3 million, or from 11.6 to 6.9
percent of the total population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. After the war, Congress passed special
legislation enabling war and political refugees from Europe and the Soviet Union to enter the United States.
[…]

50

In 1965, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, which did away with quotas based on
nationality and allowed U.S. citizens to sponsor relatives from their countries of origin. As a result of this
act, and of subsequent legislation, the nation experienced a shift in immigration patterns. Today, the
majority of U.S. immigrants come from Asia and Latin America rather than from Europe.

Choose one of the following questions.
Number your answer clearly to show which question you have answered.
Either
1. Throughout human history people have always migrated, for some reason or another. Throughout history
too, the arrival of migrants has often ended up by alienating some sections of the receiving community.
Examine the reasons given in the text for why people migrated in past centuries, add any others you can
think of relating to each wave of migrants. Then examine the reactions of the U.S. population that
received these “historical” migrants. Does history repeat itself? Discuss your views in an essay of about
300 words.
Or
2. There are two main categories of reasons why people migrate: push reasons and pull reasons. Push is
when people are forced to move in order to survive because of the political, economic, social or religious
situation in their country of origin. Pull migration is when they choose (often for economic betterment)
to move and start a new life elsewhere. Usually migrants move for a mixture of push and pull factors.
Using both the information in the text and your personal knowledge of the situation now, suggest why
people are moving today. Discuss your views in an essay of about 300 words.

My father's generation was not one accustomed to discussing and analysing in the way ours is and I believe
the telling and retelling of this story was as close as my father ever came to reflecting critically on the
profession he practised. As such, it gives a vital clue to his thinking. The story was an apparently true one
concerning a certain butler who had travelled with his employer to India and served there for many years
maintaining amongst the native staff the same high standards he had commanded in England. One
afternoon, evidently, this butler had entered the dining room to make sure all was well for dinner, when he
noticed a tiger languishing beneath the dining table. The butler had left the dining room quietly, taking care
to close the doors behind him, and proceeded calmly to the drawing room where his employer was taking
tea with a number of visitors. There he attracted his employer's attention with a polite cough, then whispered
in the latter's ear: "I'm very sorry, sir, but there appears to be a tiger in the dining room. Perhaps you will
permit the twelve-bores to be used?"
And according to legend, a few minutes later, the employer and his guests heard three gun shots. When
the butler reappeared in the drawing room some time afterwards to refresh the teapots, the employer had
inquired if all was well.

‘Perfectly fine, thank you, sir,’ had come the reply. ‘Dinner will be served at the usual time and I am
pleased to say there will be no discernible traces left of the recent occurrence by that time.’ […]
I hope you will agree that in these two instances I have cited from his career – both of which I have had
corroborated and believe to be accurate- my father not only manifests, but comes close to being the
personification itself, of what the Hayes Society terms ‘dignity in keeping with his position’. If one
considers the differences between my father at such moments and figures such as Mr Jack Neighbours even
with the best of his technical flourishes, I believe one may begin to distinguish what it is that separate a
‘great’ butler from a merely competent one. We may now understand better, too, why my father was so
fond of the story of the butler who failed to panic on discovering a tiger under the dining table; it was
because he knew instinctively that somewhere in this story lay the kernel of what true 'dignity' is. And let
me now posit this: 'dignity' has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the professional being
he inhabits. Lesser butlers will abandon their professional being for the private one at the least provocation.
For such persons, being a butler is like playing some pantomime role; a small push, a slight stumble, and
the facade will drop off to reveal the actor underneath. The great butlers are great by virtue of their ability
to inhabit their professional role and inhabit it to the utmost; they will not be shaken out by external events,
however surprising, alarming or vexing. They wear their professionalism as a decent gentleman will wear
his suit: he will not let ruffians or circumstance tear it off him in the public gaze; he will discard it when,
and only when, he wills to do so, and this will invariably be when he is entirely alone. It is, as I say, a matter
of 'dignity'.
It is sometimes said that butlers only truly exist in England. Other countries, whatever title is actually
used, have only manservants. I tend to believe this is true. Continentals are unable to be butlers because
they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of.
Continentals - and by and large the Celts, as you will no doubt agree - are as a rule unable to control
themselves in moments of strong emotion, and are thus unable to maintain a professional demeanour other
than in the least challenging of situations. If I may return to my earlier metaphor - you will excuse

my putting it so coarsely - they are like a man who will, at the slightest provocation, tear off his suit and
his shirt and run about screaming. In a word, 'dignity' is beyond such persons. We English have an important
advantage over foreigners in this respect and it is for this reason that when you think of a great butler, he is
bound, almost by definition, to be an Englishman.

The Art World View – ABCs of Cultural Placemaking:
Authenticity, Buy-in and Connectivity

5

10

With the recent UNESCO report making the case for a focus on culture to mitigate the challenges of the
unprecedented growth of cities, cultural placemaking has moved beyond a ‘nice to have’ and into pole
position for ensuring economically viable, healthy, sustainable communities. The magic ingredient lies not
in imposed ideals of what culture should be, but rather in unpicking the complex social fabric and the
history, recorded and anecdotal, that makes a place unique. The spirit of a place matters – and can be the
most important element in creating genuine, thriving places.
Arts and culture can be a catalyst to illuminate authenticity of place, and often it can be simple and
community based initiatives that have the most impact. Our work on Sneinton Market Square, in
collaboration with Nottingham City Council and Patel Taylor Architects, brought lead artist Neville Gabie
to build a narrative identity for the Square’s regeneration. In honour of the site’s long history in food
production and distribution, Gabie’s resulting commission “Orchard” used apple trees as a lynchpin to bring
diverse elements of the local community together with a common purpose, by creating an apple tree
adoption network. A programme of events involving local artists drew people back to the Square,
celebrating its past and creating a sustainable vision for its future.

15

For developers competing in a challenging market, drawing out authentic elements of their sites can create
distinctive identity. Enlighted developers Stanhope and Mitsui have used contemporary art to illustrate the
unique history of their Angel Court site in the City of London. Artist Sara Barker’s work Last of Light
(Three Needles) which dominates the Angel Court piazza beautifully highlights motifs drawn from the
area’s history of tailoring, connecting the old with the new.

20

Gaining buy-in to the vision for the development or regeneration of a place is integral to its long-term
success. Slick marketing and public announcements won’t go far in capturing the hearts and souls of
existing communities, and local objections to proposed plans can lead to costly delays. However creative
approaches can often galvanise communities and generate embedded cultural memory in ways that
marketing cannot. Artist-led community engagement has the effect of generating emotive relationships to
place through a period of change. To support Grosvenor’s London Estate 20 year vision, our team were
appointed to develop a Culture and Animation Strategy with the aim of bringing existing cultural
establishments, local communities and visitors to the area together to celebrate the historic context of the
location whilst building a reputation for contemporary, forward looking and inclusive cultural initiatives.

Public engagement is key – the central element of our Public Art Strategy for the University of Cambridge’s
North West Cambridge Development is the programme of public events, reaching audiences with
information shared through a bespoke website which acts as a living archive of the arts programme. “The
arts strategy developed by the Contemporary Art Society […] is innovative –in seeing artists as some of the
first inhabitants of the site and using their activity to generate awareness of the development. Opportunities
to engage new and existing communities are built into all aspects of the programme – across artists’
activity, education programmes and temporary and permanent public art commissions.” Roger Taylor,

Cultural placemaking has to take a holistic approach – where the question ‘Where is the cultural element?’
becomes an essential part of the planning and developer toolkit. Cultural animation can extend beyond
public art programming into functional and design elements – offering a visual language for wayfinding,
lighting and street furniture, creating distinctive and memorable local identity and exploring the digital realm
as a way of connecting people.
Our cultural strategy work is becoming well known for this forensic examination of place and responses
that draw inspiration from what is there to inform what may become. We work with developers,
landowners, cultural institutions and the public sector to generate these approaches, seeing the public realm
as a platform for culture in its widest sense, bringing contemporary art practice to new audiences and
building important cultural ecologies. F. Nicholas
