I
La letteratura ed i mondi possibili: “la forza di attrazione della narrazione, la voce narrante, i tratti
distintivi dei personaggi principali, la verosimiglianza e, al contempo, la discrepanza della realtà
narrata rispetto a quella reale danno al lettore la certezza di essere sul punto di entrare in un mondo
possibile al quale crederà, fiducioso nell’esperienza estetica, emotiva e fenomenologica a cui
l’invenzione dell’autore darà forma.” (T. Pavel)
Anche facendo riferimento ad opere appartenenti alla produzione letteraria in una delle lingue straniere
studiate, commenta come la letteratura e lo spazio della scrittura estendono le capacità creative dello
scrittore e permettono al lettore l’accesso a “mondi possibili”, che diventano concreti pur in mancanza
di consistenza materiale rispetto al mondo reale.
II
Lo sviluppo della capacità imprenditoriale dei cittadini è uno degli obiettivi chiave delle politiche
europee, necessario per una società basata sulla conoscenza e sull’apprendimento permanente.
EntreComp: The Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (2016) e la più recente guida per l’utente
Entre Comp Into Action (2018) sviluppano il concetto di imprenditorialità come “una competenza
trasversale che si applica a tutte le sfere della vita: dallo sviluppo personale, alla partecipazione
attiva nella società, dall’ ingresso nel mercato del lavoro, all’avvio di nuove iniziative di valore
culturale, sociale o commerciale”
Esprimi la tua idea di come può la scuola promuovere e sostenere lo sviluppo dello spirito di iniziativa
ed imprenditorialità tra i giovani favorendo l’autonomia delle persone e stabilendo sinergie tra
istruzione, lavoro e partecipazione civica.
III
“Il dominio della tecnica”, considerato il tratto distintivo del post-moderno, “caratterizza ancor più
marcatamente il nostro tempo, profondamente mutato dalle nuove tecnologie e dalle loro implicazioni
sociali” (A. Soro). La crescente invasività delle tecnologie digitali, dell’intelligenza artificiale e dei
Big Data rendono necessario rivendicare un ruolo attivo e consapevole rispetto ad un predominio
tecnologico sempre più totalizzante e difficile da arginare. Ciò è, soprattutto necessario, come difesa al
diritto alla privacy, alla libertà di pensiero e di parola e alla partecipazione democratica.
Cosa si dovrebbe fare, secondo te, per tutelare la persona e il diritto agli spazi di libertà individuale
senza tuttavia rinunciare agli indiscutibili vantaggi delle nuove tecnologie?

That afternoon I addressed myself to forging a note. Now, what were the names of books written by
H. L. Mencken? I did not know any of them. I finally wrote what I thought would be a foolproof note:
Dear Madam: Will you please let this nigger boy – I used the word “nigger” to make the librarian feel
that I could not possibly be the author of the note – have some books by H. L. Mencken? I forged the
white man’s name.
I entered the library as I had always done when on errands for whites, but I felt that I would somehow
slip up and betray myself. I doffed my hat, stood a respectful distance from the desk, looked as
unbookish as possible, and waited for the white patrons to be taken care of. When the desk was clear
of people, I still waited. The white librarian looked at me.
“What do you want, boy?”
As though I did not possess the power of speech, I stepped forward and simply handed her the forged
note, not parting my lips.
“What books by Mencken does he want?” she asked. “I don’t know, ma’am,” I said, avoiding her eyes.
“Who gave you this card?”
“Mr. Falk,” I said.
“Where is he?”
“He’s at work, at the M….. Optical Company,” I said. “I’ve been in here for him before.”
“I remember,” the woman said. “But he never wrote notes like this.”
Oh, God, she’s suspicious. Perhaps she would not let me have the books? If she had turned her back at
that moment, I would have ducked out the door and never gone back. Then I thought of a bold idea.
“You can call him up, ma’am,” I said, my heart pounding.
“You’re not using these books, are you?” she asked pointedly.
“Oh, no, ma’am. I can’t read.”
“I don’t know what he wants by Mencken,” she said under her breath.
I knew now that I had won; she was thinking of other things and the race question had gone out of her
mind. She went to the shelves. Once or twice she looked over her shoulder at me, as though she was
still doubtful. Finally she came forward with two books in her hand.
“I’m sending him two books,” she said. “But tell Mr. Falk to come in next time, send me the names of
the books he wants. I don’t know what he wants to read.”
I said nothing. She stamped the card and handed me the books. Not daring to glance at them, I went
out of the library, fearing that the woman would call me back for further questioning. A block away
from the library I opened one of the books and read a title: A Book of Prefaces. I was nearing my
nineteenth birthday and I did not know how to pronounce the word “preface.” I thumbed the pages and
saw strange names. I shook my head, disappointed. I looked at the other book; it was called Prejudices.
I knew what that word meant; I had heard it all my life. And right off I was on guard against Mencken
books. Why would a man want to call a book Prejudices? The word was so stained with all my
memories of racial hate that I would not conceive of anybody using it for a title. Perhaps I had made a
mistake about Mencken? A man who had prejudices must be wrong.
When I showed the books to Mr. Falk, he looked at me and frowned.
“That librarian might telephone you,” I warned him.
“That’s all right,” he said. “But when you’re through reading those books, I want you to tell me what
you get out of them.” What does Mr Falk want the narrator to do?

That night in my rented room, while letting the hot water run over my can of pork and beans in the
sink, I opened A Book of Prefaces and began to read. I was jarred and shocked by the style, the clear,
clean, sweeping sentences. Why did he write like that? And how did one write like that? I pictured the
man as a raging demon, slashing with his pen, consumed with hate, denouncing everything American,
extolling everything European or German, laughing at the weaknesses of people, mocking God,
authority. What was this? I stood up, trying to realize what reality lay behind the meaning of the
words... Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using them
as one would use a club. Could words be weapons? Well, yes, for here they were. Then, maybe,
perhaps, I could use them as a weapon? No. It frightened me. I read on and what amazed me was not
what he said, but how on earth anybody had the courage to say it.

Iceland makes it illegal to pay men more than women
Iceland has become the first country in the world to make it illegal to pay men more than women.
Under the legislation, companies and government agencies with more than 25 employees will be
required to obtain government certification for their equal-pay policies. Those failing to demonstrate
pay equality will face fines.
5

"It's a mechanism to ensure women and men are being paid equally," Dagny Osk Aradottir Pind, a
board member of the Icelandic Women's Rights Association, told Al Jazeera. "We have had legislation
saying that pay should be equal for men and women for decades now but we still have a pay gap." The
law came into effect on Monday, the first day of the new year. It was announced on International
Women's Day on 8 March last year.

10

The legislation was supported by Iceland's centre-right coalition government, as well as the opposition,
in the country's parliament, where nearly 50 per cent of members are women. "I think that now people
are starting to realise that this is a systematic problem that we have to tackle with new methods," Ms
Aradottir Pind told Al Jazeera.

She added: "Women have been talking about this for decades and I really feel that we have managed to
raise awareness, and we have managed to get to the point that people realise that the legislation we
have had in place is not working, and we need to do something more."
Iceland, which has a strong economy based on tourism and fisheries, has been ranked the best in the
world for gender equality by the World Economic Forum for nine years in a row. The UK came in
15th place in 2017, with a 16.9 per cent pay gap between men and women. Iceland's government has
committed to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2022.
Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, told The Independent: “Unequal pay is already
illegal [in the UK], but what Iceland are doing is requiring employers to take a proactive approach with
government certifying what they have done.”

“From April this year the UK is introducing gender pay gap reporting, which will require employers
with over 250 employees to publish their gender pay gaps. This is a welcome step forward, but we may
need to consider more proactive measures, particularly to tackle workplace harassment and
discrimination which have been highlighted recently as a major issue in many workplaces.” She added:
“We must also remember that this isn’t just about what is in women’s interests. Holding women back
holds our economy back. Tackling gender inequality and discrimination is good for business and for
all of us.”
For Icelanders, it is a source of pride to be the frontrunner in the World Economic Forum’s Global
Gender Gap Index for the ninth year in a row. Ranking at the top is a confirmation of the successes
achieved in recent decades and inspires us to continue to work towards complete equality of status,
influence and power of men and women.

35

What is the secret to Iceland’s success? What are the lessons learned? In short, it is that gender
equality does not come about of its own accord. It requires the collective action and solidarity of
women human rights defenders, political will, and tools such as legislation, gender budgeting and
quotas.

Iceland, despite being an island, is not isolated from progress towards gender equality. As is the case
worldwide, our incremental progress can firstly be attributed to the solidarity of women human rights
defenders challenging and protesting the monopoly of power in the hands of men […] and the power
of men over women.
Secondly, the success can be attributed to women taking power and creating alternatives to the male
dominant “truths” and making the invisible realities of women visible, most importantly
discriminatory practices including sexual harassment and abuse. Lastly, Iceland’s progress can be
attributed to women and men sharing power with each other as decision-makers and gradually having
more men supporting the give and take of gender equality.
As such, the Icelandic case is nothing exceptional. It has been influenced by cultural, political,
religious, social, academic and economic currents that have washed ashore and been domestically
cultivated and created. […]

COMPOSITION:
In her novel “Wolf Hall”, Hilary Mantel, suggests “When you are writing laws you are testing words to
find their utmost power. Like spells, they have to make things happen in the real world, and like spells,
they only work if people believe in them.” People have to accept a law, if it is to be enforced. Comment
on this quote in the light of what you have just read about Iceland (top of the World Economic gender
equality list). Do you think the gender pay gap should be closed, that there should be equal pay for
equal work? Discuss your views on the topic in an essay of about 300 words.
