Tuesday morning, then, in the kitchen. Reenie and Mother were making the bread. No: Reenie was making
the bread, and Mother was having a cup of tea. Reenie had said to Mother that she wouldn’t be surprised if
there was thunder later in the day, the air was so heavy, and shouldn’t Mother be out in the shade, or lying
down; but Mother had said she hated doing nothing. She said it made her feel useless; she said she’d like
to keep Reenie company.
Mother could walk on water as far as Reenie was concerned, and in any case she had no power to order her
around. So Mother sat drinking her tea while Reenie stood at the table, turning the mound of bread dough,
pushing down into it with both hands, folding, turning, pushing down. Her hands were covered with flour;
she looked as if she had white floury gloves on. There was flour on the bib of her apron too. She had halfcircles of sweat under her arms, darkening the yellow daisies on her house dress. Some of the loaves were
already shaped and in the pans, with a clean, damp dishtowel over each one. The humid mushroom smell
filled the kitchen.
The kitchen was hot, because the oven needed a good bed of coals, and also because there was a heat wave.
The window was open, the wave of heat rolled in through it. The flour for the bread came out of the big
barrel in the pantry. You should never climb into that barrel because the flour could get into your nose and
mouth and smother you. Reenie had known a baby who was stuck into the flour barrel upside down by its
brothers and sisters and almost choked to death.
Laura and I were under the kitchen table. I was reading an illustrated book for children called Great Men
of History. Napoleon was in exile on the island of St. Helena, standing on a cliff with his hand inside his
coat. I thought he must have a stomach ache. Laura was restless. She crawled out from under the table to
get a drink of water. “You want some dough to make a bread man?” said Reenie.
“No,” said Laura
“No, thank you,” said Mother.

25

Laura crawled back under the table. We could see the two pairs of feet, Mother’s narrow ones and Reenie’s
wider ones in their sturdy shoes, and Mother’s skinny legs and Reenie’s plump ones in their pinky-brown
stockings. We could hear the muffled turning and thumping of the bread dough. Then all of a sudden the
teacup shattered and Mother was down on the floor, and Reenie was kneeling beside her. “Oh dear God,”
she was saying. “Iris, go get your father.”

from The Blind Assassin, 2000 (Margaret Atwood, 1939 - )

Question B
Read the following text
Kenyan science teacher Peter Tabichi wins global prize
A science teacher from rural Kenya, who gives away most of his salary to support poorer pupils, has won
a $1m prize (£760,000) for the world's best teacher.
Peter Tabichi, a member of the Franciscan religious order, won the 2019 Global Teacher Prize.
5

Brother Peter has been praised for his achievements in a deprived school with crowded classes and few
textbooks.
He wants pupils to see "science is the way to go" for their futures.
The award, announced in a ceremony in Dubai, recognises the "exceptional" teacher's commitment to pupils
in a remote part of Kenya's Rift Valley.

10

He gives away 80% of his pay to support pupils, at the Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Pwani
Village, Nakuru, who otherwise could not afford uniforms or books.
Improving science
"It's not all about money," says Brother Peter, whose pupils are almost all from very disadvantaged families.
Many are orphaned or have lost a parent.

15

The 36-year-old teacher wants to raise aspirations and to promote the cause of science, not just in Kenya
but across Africa.
On winning the prize, Brother Peter hailed the potential of Africa's young population.
"As a teacher working on the frontline I have seen the promise of its young people - their curiosity, talent,
their intelligence, their belief.

20

"Africa's young people will no longer be held back by low expectations. Africa will produce scientists,
engineers, entrepreneurs whose names will be one day famous in every corner of the world. And girls will
be a huge part of this story."
The award, in a competition run by the Varkey Foundation, has seen him beating 10,000 other nominations
from 179 countries.

25

He is a Franciscan friar, a member of the Catholic religious order founded by St Francis of Assisi in the
13th Century.
Brother Peter says there are "challenges with a lack of facilities" at his school, including not enough books
or teachers.
Classes meant to have 35 to 40 pupils are taught in groups of 70 or 80, which, he says, means overcrowded
classrooms and problems for teachers.

30

The lack of a reliable internet connection means he has to travel to a cyber-cafe to download resources for
his science lessons.
And many of the pupils walk more than four miles (6km) on bad roads to reach the school.
But Brother Peter says he is determined to give them a chance to learn about science and to raise their
horizons.

35

His pupils have been successful in national and international science competitions, including an award from
the Royal Society of Chemistry in the UK.
The judges said that his work at the school had "dramatically improved his pupils' achievement", with many
more now going on to college or university, despite resources at the schools being "severely constrained".

PART 2 - WRITTEN PRODUCTION
Complete both Task A and Task B.

Friendship can develop in different ways, sometimes we become good friends with someone after a long
time, some other times it takes shortly. Discuss the quotation in a 300-word essay. Refer to your readings
