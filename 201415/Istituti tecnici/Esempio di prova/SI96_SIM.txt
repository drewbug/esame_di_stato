“I’ll meet you at 5pm on the Arduaine Point jetty,” the island’s owner, Eddie Gully, had said in the
handwritten letter he’d sent me a few weeks earlier. A study of a map revealed our mainland
rendezvous to be a mere 100 miles north-west of Glasgow. Perversely, that’s probably the reason
Shuna has stayed under the radar for so long: most tourists in search of Hebridean enchantment
head further north to well-known islands of Mull and Skye. Those who do stay south make for Islay
or Jura, and fail to spot the tiny cluster that is the Slate Islands, one of which is Shuna (not to be
confused with the island of the same name in Loch Linnhe to the north).
It took just 10 minutes in Eddie’s trim vessel for the Boat House, one of five Isle of Shuna cottages,
to heave into view. Tucked behind a rudimentary harbour and dwarfed by the mass of Shuna’s
wooded hills, our accommodation was a dainty blue lozenge, its seaward end – almost entirely of
glass – a flash of light in the sunshine. My two companions and I bundled gleefully up its stairs to a
bright, modern living area with a swish kitchen and a balcony for breakfasting in the company of
swallows. A few minutes’ training from Rob and Kathryn James – the island’s affable managers
and its only permanent population – in operating the little ex-military assault boats, and Shuna and
its salty environs were all ours.
Over the week we became aware of the distinct cadences of Shuna, whose only timetable is the
rising and setting of the sun. It has no televisions or radios to disturb the peace. Its otters, buzzards,
porpoises, seals and deer are there again tomorrow if you miss them today. The only event we could
set our watches by was Rob dropping off a printed weather forecast each morning so we could
gauge whether it was safe to take the boats out. It was it usually fine, so we circumnavigated the
island, also acquainting ourselves with the modest hills and defiant hamlets of Luing, Shuna’s more
substantial neighbour to the west.
Exploring on foot we found that, although only three miles long by one-and-a-half wide, Shuna
does not give up its treasures easily. We moseyed happily for hours through scrub birch and oak
copses, but somehow overlooked the little cove that harbours the island’s shipwreck (an elderly
wooden ferry hauled up to moulder away). Later in the week, intent on seeking out some ancient
graves, we marched up sylvan hill and down marshy dale but had to content ourselves with some
iron age burial mounds and a brace of ruined mills from Shuna’s more populous past. We weren’t
too upset, for the walk had included red deer sightings, a mammoth rockpooling session and the
gorgeous sight of Shuna Castle burnished by an early summer sun.
Ah yes, Shuna Castle. Built in 1911 by adventurer and philanthropist George Alexander MacLean
Buckley, with no expense spared, the crenellated pile was abandoned in the 1980s and, like the

35

ferry and mills, is now crumbling away. That’s not to say that Shuna lives in the past: the Boat
House is lit by LEDs and most of the electricity for the island’s five holiday properties comes from
solar panels and a small wind turbine.
“We’ve got plans to go 100% green,” said Eddie, who was born and brought up on the island.

Eddie’s joy at Shuna’s many charms was infectious, and not the least of them is its isolation. It gave
the feel of an adventure to our midweek trip to replenish provision. We sailed north past a
sprinkling of isles encrusted with tooth-like rocks and speckled with impossibly remote houses.
Beyond Ardmaddy Castle, on the mainland, we cruised, our little outboard motor throbbing away,
until we landed, an hour after we had set out, at Balvicar on Seil.
And so the days passed in a timeless haze. When we weren’t exploring, we were pootling about on
sit-on kayaks, being taken out on a venerable racing catamaran, or learning archery from Rob and
Kathryn, with the castle as a picturesque backdrop.

Here, a kindly gust took one of my arrows right into the heart of the target. “Bull’s-eye!” I
exclaimed triumphantly, though I might just as well have been referring to our choice of holiday.
