In the desert, the smugglers lace their water with petrol so the smuggled won’t gulp it down and
cost more. Sometimes the trucks they’re packed into stall crossing the Sahara; they have to jump
out to push, and some are left behind when the trucks drive off again. In transit camps in Libya,
before the perilous venture across the Blue Desert, they play football, fight, and pool their scanty
resources so an even poorer friend can pay his way. One man says his tiny wooden boat was
flanked by dolphins as they made the journey, three on each side, like guardian angels, and this
was what gave him hope.
These are the people we are allowing to die in the Mediterranean. The EU’s de facto policy is to
let migrants drown to stop others coming. Last year nearly four thousand bodies were recovered
from the Med. Those are just the ones we found. The total number of arrivals in Italy in 2014
went up over 300% from the year before, to more than 170,000. And the EU’s response, driven
by the cruellest British government in living memory, was to cut the main rescue operation, Mare
Nostrum.
The inevitable result is that 500 people have already died this year. The figure for the equivalent
period in 2014 was 15. There are half a million people in Libya waiting to make the crossing.
How many more deaths can we stomach?

Migration illustrates one of the signal features of modern life, which is malice by proxy. Like
drones and derivatives, migration policy allows the powerful to inflict horrors on the powerless
without getting their hands dirty. Right now we are a diminished and reduced society, bristling
with suspicion and distrust of others even as we perversely struggle with loneliness and
alienation.
Forget the fact that this society wouldn’t work without migrants, that nobody else will pick your
vegetables and make your latte and get up at 4am to clean your office. Forget the massive tax
contribution made by migrants to the Treasury. This is not about economics. Far too often, even
the positive takes on migration are driven by numbers and finance, by “What can they do for
us?”. This is about two things: compassion and responsibility.
Lampedusa, my play currently running at the Soho Theatre, focuses on two people at the sharp
end of austerity Europe. Stefano is a coastguard whose job is to fish dead migrants out of the sea.
Denise is a collector for a payday loan company. They’re not liberals. They don’t like the people
they deal with. They can’t afford to. As Stefano says: “You try to keep them at arm’s length.
There’s too many of them. And it makes you think, about the randomness of I get to walk these
streets, and he doesn’t. The ground becomes ocean under your feet.”

But eventually, the human impact of what they do breaks through. And in their consequent
struggles, both Stefano and Denise are aided by a friendship, reluctant and questioning, with
someone they formerly thought of as a burden. This is compassion not as a lofty feeling for
someone beneath you, but as the raw reciprocal necessity of human beings who have nothing but
each other. This is where we are in the utterly corrupted, co-opted politics of the early 21st century.

40

But equally important is responsibility. In all the rage about migration, one thing is never discussed:
what we do to cause it. A report published this week by the International Consortium of
Investigative Journalists reveals that the World Bank displaced a staggering 3.4 million people in
the last five years. By funding privatisations, land grabs and dams, by backing companies and
governments accused of rape, murder and torture, and by putting $50bn into projects graded highest
risk for “irreversible and unprecedented” social impacts, the World Bank has massively contributed
to the flow of impoverished people across the globe.

45

50

A very close second is to stop bombing the Middle East. The West destroyed the infrastructure of
Libya without any clue as to what would replace it. What has is a vacuum state run by warlords that
is now the centre of Mediterranean people-smuggling. Our past work in Somalia, Syria and Iraq
means those nationalities are top of the migrant list.

55

Not all migration is caused by the West, of course. But let’s have a real conversation about the part
that is. Let’s have a real conversation about our ageing demographic and the massive skills shortage
here, what it means for overstretched public services if we let migrants in, the ethics of taking the
cream of the crop from poor countries. Migration is a complex subject. But let’s not be cowards and
pretend the migrants will stop coming. Because they won’t. This will never stop.

More than a third of betting machine players experience problems with gambling
Research commissioned by Responsible Gaming Trust contrasts with assertions made by
bookmakers over the machines.
More than a third of people playing high-speed, high-stakes betting machines experience problems
with their gambling, according to industry-funded research released on Wednesday.
5

The study involving 4,000 gamblers, which was commissioned by the Responsible Gambling
Trust, revealed alarmingly high levels of problem gambling with fixed - odds betting terminals.
FOBTs have been dubbed by critics as the “crack cocaine of gambling” because they allow stakes
of £100 to be laid every 20 seconds on casino games.

10

The researchers found that 37% of respondents experience “problems with machine gambling”
somewhere between “some of the time” to “almost always”. This compares to a problem gambling
rate of 0.4% for all adults, according to 2012 government health studies.
NatCen * also found that the players who frequent the UK’s 9,000 betting shops were likely to be
poor, jobless and not white. Bookmakers rely on the revenue from the country’s machines, which
take £1.5bn from punters.

15

20

25

Campaigners point out that the data showed that these problem gamblers were depositing huge
amounts of cash – £1,200 a week – into the machines. This from a group where a third of men had
incomes of less than £10,400 a year.
Adrian Parkinson of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, who is a former industry executive, said
the study raised questions over where the money for gambling was coming from: “We’ve long
argued that drug dealers who start money-laundering to legitimise their criminal earnings on
FOBTs, especially the younger ones, very quickly get drawn into the addictive nature of highstake roulette play. Combined with welfare payments, there is a strong case that these machines
are taking both illicit money and that of the state welfare system.”
NatCen said “Not all problem gamblers had very low incomes,” but added that it was the case that
“disproportionately more problem gamblers had low incomes than non-problem gamblers.”
The temptation of high-speed, high-stake casino games in the high street proved irresistible: there
are now about 33,000 FOBTs in the UK – a decade ago there were barely any.

30

A growing number of local authorities say they have seen a rise in the number of bookies opening
in high streets, helped by the profitability of the machines coupled with planning laws that make it
difficult to prevent their development.
Newham Council in East London is calling for the maximum stake on the machines to be lowered
from £100 to £2 – and has gathered backing from a quarter of all local authorities in England.

City Bank JP Morgan pointed out that, given at least one in four were “problem gamblers,” it
estimates “at least 10% of machine revenue could come from problem gamblers”. As this was
“significant proportion”, the analysts said, ministers would have to recommend a system where
play is monitored on the machines and punters prevented from gambling too much.
At present the industry claims that problem gamblers could be halted by putting a warning
message on the screens of the machines every time a game is played for longer than 30 minutes.
However the research makes it plain this is too long to stop harmful behaviour. The study states:
“high harmful gambling action and consequence scores had shorter session lengths, on average,
than others: their average session length was around 13 minutes compared with around 18 minutes
for other groups”.
Heather Wardle of NatCen said that there was “no question” of links between deprivation, race,
unemployment and gambling patterns. She however said that the 4,000 people surveyed were not
entirely representative of all gamblers, and that this would “skew the data”.
An Association of British Bookmakers spokesperson said: “The industry welcomes the findings of
this report and we will now use this evidence to help determine how the industry can further help
those customers who may be at risk."
“We are pleased that this research has deliberately focused on regular gamblers, rather than the
general population. Some of our members are already using gaming machine customer data to
identify potential problems and, thereby better targeting customer interventions.”

It seemed impossible that anyone should be unhappy on such beautiful morning. Nobody was,
decided Edna, except herself. The windows were flung wide in the houses. From within there came
the sound of pianos, little hands chased after each other and ran away from each other, practicing
scales. The trees fluttered in the sunny gardens, all bright with spring flowers. Street boys whistled,
a little dog barked; people passed by, walking so lightly, so swiftly, they looked as though they
wanted to break into a run. Now she actually saw in the distance a parasol, peach-coloured, the first
parasol of the year.
Perhaps even Edna didn’t look quite unhappy as she felt. It is not easy to look tragic at eighteen,
when you are extremely pretty, with the cheeks and lips and shining eyes of perfect health. Above
all, when you are wearing a French frock and your new spring hat trimmed with cornflowers. True,
she carried under her arm a book bound in horrid black leather. Perhaps the book provided a gloomy
note, but only by accident; it was the ordinary Library binding. For Edna had made going to the
Library an excuse for getting out of the house to think, to realise what had happened, to decide
somehow what was to be done now.
An awful thing had happened. Quite suddenly, at the theatre last night, when she and Jimmy were
seated side by side in the dress-circle, without a moment’s warning-in fact, she had just finished a
chocolate almond and passed the box to him again-she had fallen in love with an actor. But-fallenin-love…
The feeling was unlike anything she had ever imagined before. It wasn’t in the least pleasant. It was
hardly thrilling. Unless you can call the most dreadful sensation of hopeless misery, despair, agony
and wretchedness, thrilling. Combined with the certainty that if the actor met her on the pavement
after, while Jimmy was fetching their cab, she would follow him to the ends of the earth, at a nod, at
a sign, without giving another thought to Jimmy or her father and mother or her happy home and
countless friends again …
The play had begun fairly cheerfully. That was at the chocolate almond stage. Then the hero had
gone blind. Terrible moment! Edna had cried so much she had to borrow Jimmy’s folded, smoothfeeling handkerchief as well. Not that crying mattered. Whole rows were in tears. Even men blew
their noses with a loud trumpeting noise and tried to peer at the programme instead of looking at the
stage. Jimmy, most mercifully dry-eyed-or what would she have done without his handkerchief?squeezed her free hand, and whispered “Cheer up, darling girl!”. And it was then she had taken a
last chocolate almond to please him and passed the box again. Then there had been that ghastly
scene with the hero alone on the stage in a deserted room at twilight, with a band playing outside
and the sound of cheering coming from the street. He had tried-ah! How painfully, how pitifully!- to
grope his way to the window. He had succeeded at last. There he stood holding the curtain while
one beam of light, just one beam, shone full on his raised sightless face, and the band faded away
into the distance …

It was - really, it was absolutely - oh, the most - it was simply - in fact, from that moment Edna
knew that life could never be the same. She drew her hand away from Jimmy, leaned back, and shut
the chocolate box for ever. This at last was love!

40

Edna and Jimmy were engaged. She had had her hair up for a year and a half, they had been
publicly engaged for a year. But they had known they were going to marry each other since they
walked in the Botanical Gardens with their nurses, and sat on the grass with a wine biscuit and a
piece of barley-sugar each for their tea. It was so much an accepted thing that Edna had worn a
wonderfully good imitation of an engagement ring out of a cracker all the time she was at school.
And up till now they had been devoted to each other.

45

But now it was all over. It was so completely over that Edna found it difficult to believe that Jimmy
did not realise it too.

Cannes 2014: Mr Turner review – Timothy Spall dazzles as JMW Turner

5

What a glorious film this is, richly and immediately enjoyable, hitting its satisfying stride straight
away. It's funny and visually immaculate; it combines domestic intimacy with an epic sweep and has
a lyrical, mysterious quality that perfumes every scene, whether tragic or comic.
Mike Leigh has made a period biographical drama before: Topsy-Turvy (1999), about the rewarding
but tense association of Gilbert and Sullivan and their own rewarding but tense association with the
theatre-going public. Now he made another utterly confident excursion into the past and into the
occult arcana of Englishness and Victoriana: a study of the final years of the painter JMW Turner,
played with relish and sympathy by Timothy Spall.
In the past, I and others have commented that Leigh's dialogue in his contemporary movies has an
exaggerated, vaudevillian, neo-Dickensian quality. Now he has actually made a Dickensian movie –
accompanied, perhaps, by a shrewdly distanced critical sensibility with something of Peter Ackroyd.
There are wives and daughters and fallen women and poignantly ailing fathers and sea journeys and
huge marshy landscapes, although it is sexually explicit in a way foreign to Dickens.
The painter is a harrumphing eccentric, with a handsome establishment in London, who enjoys the
freedom that wealth and success has gained him, a freedom to roam and a freedom to speak his mind
to simpering critics and saucer-eyed buyers. He is utterly confident, exchanging banter with lesser,
prissier contemporaries at the Royal Academy, tolerant of an envious failure who begs him for a loan.
Turner has the mutton chops and bulging eyes of a Toby jug, or perhaps like the pig's head that we
see him eating – accepting another slice of cheek, his own being full and wobbly. He grunts and
growls with occasional Chewbacca whinnies; he huffs like a mill owner, or like one of those steam
engines of the Victorian age whose encroaching modernity makes Turner so uncomfortable.
Occasionally, he will spit at the canvas, and mix it up with the paint because his gluey sputum has
exactly the consistency he needs: a mannerism that shows off perfectly his forthright, uninhibited,
primitive approach – almost a kind of English art brut. But his unconventionally visionary, cloudy
canvases are making him a marginal figure in the artistic establishment and a figure of fun for the
general public.
Turner is shown to be desperately lonely, needing the company and touch of women – but culpably
irresponsible in failing to acknowledge his past liaisons and children. Ruth Sheen plays his ex-lover
Sarah Danby, who upbraids him over his indifference to his daughters. Turner prefers to live the life
of a bohemian bachelor, sexually exploiting his housekeeper, Hannah (Dorothy Atkinson) and then
becoming obsessed with his Margate seaside landlady Mrs Booth (Marion Bailey) for whom he
conceives a great, uxorious love. There is a brilliant scene in which Turner engages a prostitute,
inspects her semi-nudity and then proceeds to sketch her, bursting into unexplained tears when she
artlessly reveals how young she is. As the artist's health declines, Spall's great bearlike Turner
becomes a big, vulnerable toddler, and it is unbearably sad.

Perhaps the biggest challenge for a movie about an artist is how it is going to look.
Cinematographer Dick Pope pulls off some lovely scenes without ever giving his images a
misjudged "painterliness". There is a brilliant moment when a landscape detail looks like a painted
canvas, but the camera pulls back to reveal it is the real thing. And there is a kind of
unselfconscious majesty in the sequence in which Leigh imagines Turner actually witnessing the
scene of which he made the subject of his famous painting: he sees The Fighting Temeraire, a
veteran Trafalgar gunship being towed up the Thames on the way to being broken up. It makes
what Turner stoutly calls a "marine piece". The naval and seafaring traditions of Britain are the
wellspring of Turner's imagination, but like Turner and his vision, this tradition, and Victorian
Britain are receding into clouds of glory.
Every scene in this film is expertly managed; every comic line and funny moment adroitly
presented and every performance given with intelligence and love. It is another triumph for Mike
Leigh and for Timothy Spall.Mike Leigh's first period biopic in 15 years is a feat of confidence,
with an outstanding performance from Spall as the Romantic landscape artist
