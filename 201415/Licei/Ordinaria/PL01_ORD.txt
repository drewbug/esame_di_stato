In Nottingham, one woman is fighting food poverty with 'social eating'
Resilient People: ‘Food crisis responder’ Marsha Smith takes surplus produce from
supermarkets and cooks it for those in need. In a city suffering from food poverty, she is trying
to shake up the system for good.

“I’d call myself a ‘social eating advocate’... or maybe a ‘food crisis responder’,” says Marsha
Smith as we sit down for lunch at her home on the outskirts of Nottingham. “The fact is, some
people just want someone to cook them dinner, and there’s no harm in that.” I heartily agreed as
I tucked into the homemade vegetarian and wheat-free meal she’d just placed in front of me.
Almost every item of food on my plate had come via FareShare, an organisation that relieves
supermarkets of surplus food (food that’s in date and good to eat, but won’t be sold due to
reasons like over-ordering or incorrect labelling) and redistributes it to charities and community
projects around the UK. Marsha’s Super Kitchen is one of its 1,700 recipients. At eight locations
across Nottinghamshire, this “social eating service” offers a home-cooked meal made from
surplus and locally grown ingredients, to be eaten “like a family” for just £2-3 per head.
Once home to a thriving textiles industry, Nottingham now has the highest number of workless
households in the country, with 30.1% out of work and 32% of children living in poverty. After
brutal cuts to the council – including the scrapping of the local welfare fund – a food bank shut
in protest late last year, but the demand remains high with over 20 still serving the area.
However, with an estimated 400,000 tonnes of surplus supermarket food available in the UK
each year, Marsha wants to shift the focus from food poverty into abundance.
“We need a better mechanism for distributing all this food”, she explains. “Food banks are good
in the sense that they meet a need … but they create a cycle of dependency that doesn’t empower
anyone. What we’ve shown is that we can get it into communities and onto plates.” She believes
that many organisations providing food to those in need ignore the potential paying customers
who will financially “buoy up” projects that are feeding those who are economically vulnerable.
By avoiding council-allocated funding, she makes her business resilient to funding changes and
impacts of local politics, while offering a service that is inclusive and open to anyone.
Since April last year, Super Kitchens across Nottinghamshire have dished out 18,500 meals and
have saved over six tonnes of perfectly edible food from landfill. Marsha is also busy working
with other local food groups – growers, “cook and eat” organisations and school allotment
projects – to “unite them under a resilient brand”. This interconnectivity between projects
demonstrates the importance of a networked approach in combating issues such as food
insecurity (the experience of not knowing where the next meal will come from) in the city.

Aside from the health and environmental benefits of eating nutritious meals made from
otherwise tip-bound food, it’s the social element of Super Kitchens that Marsha is most
excited about, and what she has tapped into is nothing new. In fact, the word “companion”
comes from the latin com (together) and panis (bread), and literally translates to “bread
fellow”. “In a time when our need to eat and be sociable has been privatised, we need more
spaces to get together in,” Marsha says, and that’s what her social eating service achieves by
creating new public space in the city around food.
“You know that whenever you drop in for a meal, there’ll be someone to talk to who’s there
for the same reasons,” Marsha explains. She tells me about the single parents who visit the
kitchen weekly to give themselves a night off, or the elderly woman who found comfort in
eating a home cooked meal after her husband passed away. […]
With Super Kitchen’s first birthday around the corner, Marsha is busy working on a strategy to
persuade supermarkets to pay for public cafes where they can serve up their surplus food to a
customer base who want to connect with it for social and environmental good. “There will
always be surplus food in circulation,” she explains; “it’s a shameful outcome of our
industrialised food system”. […]
Through stitching together a network of food growers, educators, community organisations,
distributors and suppliers in Nottingham, Marsha is creating the conditions through which
urban resilience can grow. By providing spaces for individuals from different backgrounds to
meet – and eat – the fabric of a robust and adaptable society can be woven from the ground up.

Hegemony […] is not domination: it is not a physical or repressive force. It works through consensus,
through gaining the consent of the people over which leadership is sought. If there is a breakdown in the
relations of consent, then there is a crisis of authority: “if the ruling class has lost its consensus, i.e. is no
longer “leading” but only “dominant”, exercising coercive force alone, this means precisely that the
great masses have become detached from their traditional ideologies, and no longer believe what they
used to believe previously” [Gramsci, 1971: 275-6]. A class or a social group is able to become
hegemonic inasmuch as it is able to build a series of alliances. These alliances are formed through
consent, not through physical force, repression or violence. And that which cements the alliances is
ideological. Gramsci understands the cementing of alliances not through some rational process, but
through culture. He talks about engaging with the people at the level of culture, particularly the culture
of the “national-popular”: namely, those largely unconscious day-to-day traditions, customs and habits
that ground the popular culture of a nation.
It is this relation between hegemony and ideology that has provided a central focus for cultural studies.
For example, in a criticism of the dominant ideology thesis – that presumes that the dominated classes
are duped, or in a state of false consciousness, and simply imbibe the ideas and practices of the ruling
class – Tony Bennett argues that bourgeois hegemony does not simply subsume, or impose bourgeois
values and ideas on working-class culture, but rather bourgeois culture and ideology have to be
articulated (or linked) with working-class culture:
As a consequence of its accommodating elements of opposing class culture, “bourgeois culture”
ceases to be purely or entirely bourgeois. It becomes, instead, a mobile combination of cultural
and ideological elements derived from different class locations which are, but only provisionally
and for the duration of a specific historical conjuncture, affiliated to bourgeois values, interests
and objectives. (Bennett, 1986a: xv)
In this sense, ideologies are never pure; they are always, of necessity, negotiated. In order to persuade
others to consent to the ideas and practices of one group, the ideas and practices of that group need to
demonstrate that they also represent the interests of the persuaded group. Following Gramsci’s cultural
studies, scholars have shown that the domain in which this negotiation takes place is the domain of
common sense, in the realm of meaning and sensibility that is most ordinary and that is able to appeal
across classes.
Stuart Hall and his colleagues in their detailed analysis of the moral panic surrounding the construction
of the “black mugger” in the 1970s, used the notion of hegemony to show how the dominant ideology of
“law and order” gained popular consent (Hall et al., 1978). They show how the post-war social
democratic consensus in the UK began to fracture in the 1970s under the strain of a revivified political
militancy and the increasingly visible contradictions of global capitalism. As the signs of crisis began to
show, the Conservative Government of the day (under the premiership of Edward Heath) moved closer
to a neo-liberal politics at the same time as it embraced an increasing authoritarianism. An ideological
consensus was constructed through an increasing fear of crime and a racism directed at the UK’s black

population. The “black mugger” formed a condensation of these concerns and enabled the development
of an “authoritarian populism” which, in 1979, provided the platform for the onset of Thatcherism. The
ground upon which that ideological struggle was seen to be fought was that of common sense: that was
the language of the press and the television media; that was the language of ordinary people; and that
was the language that needed to be engaged with in order to bring about progressive social change.

40

In Gramsci’s writings, common sense is talked about as superstitious, traditional, folkish and
spontaneous. It is understood as fragmented and incoherent and it is understood in contrast to the unity
and coherence of ideology. […]

45

In this sense common sense is not only the ground upon which ideological battles are fought, it is also
that which needs to be contested and brought to bear under the weight of critical consciousness. Gramsci
distinguishes between a passionate sensibility and a coherent conception of the world, between common
sense and good sense. In order to change people’s minds and conduct, common sense must not be
foregone in favour of an arid knowledge, rather it must be carried over, as it is that passion that forms
the connection between the leaders and those who are led.

Annie stood at the coffee machine in the corridor outside the intensive care unit and watched the rain
gusting in great swathes across the parking lot. An old man was having a fight with a recalcitrant
umbrella and two nuns were being swept like sailboats toward their car. The clouds looked low and
mean enough to bump their wimpled heads.
5

The coffee machine gave a last gurgle and Annie extracted the cup and took a sip. It tasted just as
revolting as the other hundred cups she’d had from it. But at least it was hot and wet and had caffeine in
it. She walked slowly back into the unit, saying hello to one of the younger nurses coming off shift.
“She’s looking good today,” the nurse said as they passed.

10

“You think?” Annie looked at her. All the nurses knew her well enough by now not to say such things
lightly.
“Yes, I do.” She paused at the door and it seemed for a moment as if she wanted to say something else.
But she thought better of it and pushed the door open, going.
“Just you keep working those muscles!” she said.
Annie saluted. “Yes, ma’am!”

Looking good. What did looking good mean, she wondered as she walked back to Grace’s bed, when
you were in your eleventh day of coma and your limbs were as slack as dead fish? Another nurse was
changing the dressing on Grace’s leg. Annie stood and watched. The nurse looked up and smiled and
got on with the job. It was the only job Annie couldn’t bring herself to do. They encouraged parents and
relatives to get involved. She and Robert had become quite expert at the physical therapy and all the
other things that had to be done, like cleaning Grace’s mouth and eyes and changing the urine bag that
hung down beside the bed. But even the thought of Grace’s stump sent Annie into a sort of frozen panic.
She could barely look at it, let alone touch it.
“It’s healing nicely”, the nurse said. Annie nodded and forced herself to keep watching. They had taken
the stitches out two days ago and the long, curved scar was a vivid pink. The nurse saw the look in
Annie’s eyes.
“I think her tape’s run out,” she said, nodding toward Grace’s Walkman on the pillow.

30

The nurse was giving her an escape from the scar and Annie gratefully took it. She ejected the spent
tape, some Chopin suites, and found a Mozart opera in the locker, The Marriage of Figaro. She slotted it
into the Walkman and adjusted the earphones on Grace’s head. She knew this was hardly the choice
Grace would have made. She always claimed she hated opera. But Annie was damned if she was going
to play the doom-laden tapes Grace listened to in the car. Who knew what Nirvana or Alice in Chains
might do to a brain so bruised? Could she even hear in there? And if so, would she wake up loving
opera? More likely, just hating her mother for yet another act of tyranny, Annie concluded.

She wiped a trickle of saliva from the corner of Grace’s mouth and tidied a strand of hair. She let her hand
rest there and stared down at her. After a while she became aware that the nurse had finished dressing the
leg and was watching her. They smiled at each other. But there was a trace of something perilously close
to pity in the nurse’s eyes and Annie swiftly broke the moment.
“Workout time!” she said.

45

She pushed up her sleeves and pulled a chair closer to the bed. The nurse gathered up her things and soon
Annie was alone again. She always started with Grace’s left hand and she took it now in both of hers and
began working the fingers one by one then all of them together. Backward and forward, opening and
closing each joint, feeling the knuckles crack as she squeezed them. Now the thumb, revolving it,
squashing the muscle and kneading it with her fingers. She could hear the tinny sound of the Mozart
spilling from Grace’s earphones and she found a rhythm in the music and worked to it, manipulating the
wrist now.

[….]Modernism in art marks a point before which painters set about representing the world the way it
presented itself, painting people and landscapes and historical events just as they would present
themselves to the eye. With modernism, the conditions of representation themselves become central, so
that art in a way becomes its own subject. This was almost precisely the way in which Clement
Greenberg defined the matter in his famous 1960 essay "Modernist Painting." "The essence of
Modernism," he wrote, "lies, as I see it, in the use of the characteristic methods of a discipline to
criticize the discipline itself, not in order to subvert it but in order to entrench it more firmly in its area
of competence." Interestingly, Greenberg took as his model of modernist thought the philosopher
Immanuel Kant: "Because he was the first to criticize the means itself of criticism, I conceive of Kant as
the first real Modernist." Kant did not see philosophy as adding to our knowledge so much as answering
the question of how knowledge was possible. And I suppose the corresponding view of painting would
have been not to represent the appearances of things so much as answering the question of how painting
was possible. The question then would be: who was the first modernist painter--who deflected the art of
painting from its representational agenda to a new agenda in which the means of representation became
the object of representation?
For Greenberg, Manet became the Kant of modernist painting: "Manet's became the first Modernist
pictures by virtue of the frankness with which they declared the flat surfaces on which they were
painted." And the history of modernism moved from there through the impressionists, "who abjured
underpainting and glazes, to leave the eye under no doubt as to the fact that the colors they used were
made of paint that came from tubes or pots," to Cezanne, who "sacrificed verisimilitude, or correctness,
in order to fit his drawing and design more explicitly to the rectangular shape of the canvas." And step
by step Greenberg constructed a narrative of modernism to replace the narrative of the traditional
representational painting defined by Vasari. Flatness, the consciousness of paint and brushstroke, the
rectangular shape--all of them what Meyer Schapiro speaks of as "nonmimetic features" of what may
still have been residually mimetic paintings--displaced perspective, foreshortening, chiaroscuro as the
progress points of a developmental sequence. The shift from "premodernist" to modernist art, if we
follow Greenberg, was the shift from mimetic to nonmimetic features of painting. It was not, Greenberg
asserts, that painting had to become itself nonobjective or abstract. It was just that its representational
features were secondary in modernism where they had been primary in premodernist art. Much of my
book, concerned as it is with narratives of the history of art, must perforce deal with Greenberg as the
great narrativist of modernism.
It is important that the concept of modernism, if Greenberg is right, is not merely the name of a stylistic
period which begins in the latter third of the nineteenth century, the way in which Mannerism is the
name of a stylistic period which begins in the first third of the sixteenth century: Mannerist follows
Renaissance painting and is followed by the baroque, which is followed by rococo, which is followed by
neoclassicism, which is followed by the romantic. These were deep changes in the way painting

represents the world, changes, one might say, in coloration and mood, and they develop out of and to
some degree in reaction against their predecessors, as well as in response to all sorts of extra-artistic
forces in history and in life. My sense is that modernism does not follow romanticism in this way, or not
merely: it is marked by an ascent to a new level of consciousness, which is reflected in painting as a kind
of discontinuity, almost as if to emphasize that mimetic representation had become less important than
some kind of reflection on the means and methods of representation. Painting begins to look awkward,
or forced (in my own chronology it is Van Gogh and Gauguin who are the first modernist painters). In
effect, modernism sets itself at a distance from the previous history of art, I suppose in the way in which
adults, in the words of Saint Paul, "put aside childish things." The point is that "modern" does not merely
mean "the most recent."
